1
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,627
Yo ho
Yo ho

2
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:49,756
A pirate's life for me

3
00:00:49,798 --> 00:00:54,594
We extort, we pilfer
We filch, we sack

4
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:57,138
- Drink...
- Quiet, missy!

5
00:00:57,222 --> 00:00:59,599
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

6
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:01,934
You don't want to bring
them down on us, do ya?

7
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:03,811
Mr Gibbs, that will do.

8
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,481
She was singing about pirates!

9
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:08,649
Bad luck to be singing about pirates

10
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:11,903
with us mired in this unnatural fog,
mark my words.

11
00:01:11,987 --> 00:01:13,321
Consider them marked.

12
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:17,492
- On your way.
- Aye, Lieutenant.

13
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:19,660
Bad luck to have a woman on board, too.

14
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:21,954
Even a miniature one.

15
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:25,541
I think it'd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

16
00:01:27,252 --> 00:01:29,337
Think again, Miss Swann.

17
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:32,256
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of 'em.

18
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:35,468
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

19
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:38,137
or wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves.

20
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:41,516
A short drop and a sudden stop.

21
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:48,189
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervour,

22
00:01:48,232 --> 00:01:52,860
but I'm concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter.

23
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:54,737
My apologies, Governor Swann.

24
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:57,031
Actually, I find it all fascinating.

25
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,866
Yes. That's what concerns me.

26
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:28,146
Look! A boy!

27
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,564
There's a boy in the water!

28
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:33,359
Man overboard!

29
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:36,946
Man the ropes!
Fetch a hook!

30
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:39,115
Haul him aboard!

31
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,584
He's still breathing.

32
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:51,919
Mary, Mother of God!

33
00:02:58,468 --> 00:02:59,927
What happened here?

34
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,141
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

35
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:08,811
Lot of good it did them.

36
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:11,439
Everyone's thinking it,
I'm just saying it.

37
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:13,524
Pirates!

38
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:16,444
There's no proof of that!

39
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:18,029
It was probably an accident.

40
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,407
Rouse the captain immediately.

41
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,367
- Aye, sir.
- Heave to and take in sail.

42
00:03:23,452 --> 00:03:25,119
- Lower the boats.
- Heave to!

43
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,624
Elizabeth, I want you
to accompany the boy.

44
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,126
He'll be in your charge.

45
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:33,836
Take care of him.

46
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:54,815
It's OK.

47
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:57,652
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

48
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:00,404
Will Turner.

49
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:03,324
I'm watching over you, Will.

50
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,838
You're a pirate!

51
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,091
Has he said anything?

52
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:21,759
His name's William Turner.

53
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:23,344
That's all I found out.

54
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:25,388
Take him below.

55
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,084
Elizabeth!

56
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:40,755
Are you all right?

57
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:43,299
Are you decent?

58
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:44,925
Yes.

59
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:45,968
Yes?

60
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:48,929
Still in bed at this hour?

61
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:52,433
It's a beautiful day.

62
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,354
I have a gift for you.

63
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:02,276
- Oh, it's beautiful!
- Isn't it?

64
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:05,905
May I inquire as to the occasion?

65
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:09,033
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

66
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:11,994
Go on.

67
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:16,957
Actually, I...

68
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:21,253
I had hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

69
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:22,588
Ceremony?

70
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:25,049
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.

71
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:26,300
I knew it!

72
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,678
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

73
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:31,680
A fine gentleman, don't you think?

74
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:33,974
He fancies you, you know.

75
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,060
Elizabeth?

76
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:37,812
How's it coming?

77
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:39,647
It's difficult to say.

78
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:42,817
I'm told it's the
latest fashion in London.

79
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:44,235
Well, women in London

80
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,986
must've learned not to breathe!

81
00:06:48,156 --> 00:06:49,824
My Lord, you have a visitor.

82
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:09,343
Mr Turner.

83
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:10,845
Good to see you again.

84
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:12,054
Good day, sir.

85
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:14,849
I have your order.

86
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:21,522
Well...

87
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:23,357
The blade is folded steel.

88
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:26,444
That's gold filigree
laid into the handle.

89
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:28,404
If I may?

90
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:32,032
Perfectly balanced.

91
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:35,119
The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade.

92
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,207
Impressive. Very impressive.

93
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,584
Very nice.

94
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:45,254
Commodore Norrington's going
to be very pleased with this.

95
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:48,883
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

96
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:52,052
I shall.

97
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:56,849
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

98
00:07:58,351 --> 00:08:01,854
Elizabeth! You look absolutely stunning.

99
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:02,897
Will.

100
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,733
It's so good to see you.

101
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:08,694
I had a dream about you last night.

102
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:09,820
About me?

103
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:11,489
Is it entirely proper for you...

104
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:13,407
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

105
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,243
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

106
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:18,829
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

107
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:21,165
At least once more, Miss Swann.

108
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:23,083
As always.

109
00:08:23,126 --> 00:08:24,418
Now, you see?

110
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:26,754
At least the boy
has a sense of propriety.

111
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:28,088
We really must be going.

112
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:29,131
Come on.

113
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:31,759
Good day, Mr Turner.

114
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:34,345
Come along!

115
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:38,933
Good day...

116
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,270
...Elizabeth.

117
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,654
Hold up there, you!

118
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:20,659
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.

119
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:24,371
And I shall need to know your name.

120
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:29,335
What do you say to three shillings,

121
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:30,628
and we forget the name?

122
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,300
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr Smith.

123
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:14,588
Two paces... march!

124
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:19,134
Right about... face!

125
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,431
Present... arms!

126
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,458
This dock is off limits to civilians.

127
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,293
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.

128
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:56,046
If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

129
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:03,262
Apparently, there's some high-toned
and fancy to-do up at the fort, eh?

130
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:06,473
How could it be two upstanding
gentlemen, such as yourselves,

131
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:08,517
did not merit an invitation?

132
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:11,770
Someone has to make sure this dock
stays off limit to civilians.

133
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:14,189
It's a fine goal, to be sure.

134
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:16,233
But it seems to me, a...

135
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:18,068
...a ship like that...

136
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:21,155
makes this one here
a bit superfluous, really.

137
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:24,324
Oh, the Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true enough,

138
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:28,328
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

139
00:12:28,371 --> 00:12:29,455
I've heard of one.

140
00:12:29,497 --> 00:12:32,166
It's supposed to be very fast,
nigh uncatchable.

141
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,001
The Black Pearl.

142
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:38,046
There's no real ship

143
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:39,798
that can match the Interceptor.

144
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:43,510
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

145
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:45,179
No, it's not.

146
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:46,555
Yes, it is. I've seen it!

147
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:48,390
You've seen it?

148
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:49,516
Yes.

149
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,518
You haven't seen it!

150
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:52,644
Yes, I have!

151
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,146
You've seen a ship

152
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:56,190
with black sails,

153
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:57,941
that's crewed by the damned,

154
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:00,527
and captained by a man so evil

155
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,197
that hell itself spat him back out?

156
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,241
No.

157
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:09,411
But I have seen a ship with black sails.

158
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:12,372
And no ship that's
not crewed by the damned,

159
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:15,334
and captained by a man so evil
that hell spat him back out

160
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:17,044
could possibly have black sails,

161
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:19,213
therefore couldn't possibly
be any other ship

162
00:13:19,297 --> 00:13:22,716
than the Black Pearl,
is that what you're saying?

163
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,884
No.

164
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:25,219
Like I said,

165
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:28,514
there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor...

166
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:31,975
Hey!

167
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:34,436
You!

168
00:13:35,563 --> 00:13:36,605
Get away from there!

169
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:39,066
You don't have permission
to be aboard there!

170
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:40,818
Sorry. It's such a pretty boat.

171
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:41,902
Ship!

172
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:43,654
What's your name?

173
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:44,738
Smith!

174
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:46,532
Or Smithy, if you like.

175
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:49,868
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
Mr Smith?

176
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:50,911
Yeah, and no lies!

177
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:52,454
All right then.

178
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:53,539
I confess.

179
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:57,251
It is my intention to commandeer
one of these ships, pick up a crew

180
00:13:57,335 --> 00:14:00,754
in Tortuga to rape, pillage, and pilfer
my weasely black guts out.

181
00:14:00,797 --> 00:14:02,714
I said, no lies!

182
00:14:02,757 --> 00:14:04,675
I think he's telling the truth.

183
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,301
If he were telling the truth,

184
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:07,636
he wouldn't have told us.

185
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:12,140
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe
the truth, even if he told it to you.

186
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,236
May I have a moment?

187
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:34,955
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

188
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:36,790
Yes.

189
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:40,544
I apologise if I seem forward,

190
00:14:40,628 --> 00:14:42,713
but I must speak my mind.

191
00:14:45,592 --> 00:14:48,594
This promotion throws into sharp relief

192
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:51,597
that which I have not yet achieved.

193
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:55,809
A marriage to a fine woman.

194
00:14:57,353 --> 00:15:00,022
You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.

195
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,982
I can't breathe.

196
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:03,859
Yes, I...

197
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:05,444
I'm a bit nervous myself.

198
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:10,032
And then they made me their chief.

199
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:14,036
Elizabeth?

200
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:17,748
Elizabeth!

201
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:22,711
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

202
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:27,507
- Will you be saving her, then?
- I can't swim!

203
00:15:29,677 --> 00:15:31,678
Pearl of the King's Navy, you are!

204
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:33,430
Do not lose these!

205
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:49,112
What was that?

206
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:32,948
I got her!

207
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:35,492
She's not breathing!

208
00:16:35,576 --> 00:16:36,576
Move!

209
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:45,419
I never would've thought of that.

210
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:47,754
Clearly you've never been to Singapore.

211
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:54,970
Where did you get that?

212
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:58,598
On your feet.

213
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:02,019
Elizabeth!

214
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:05,355
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

215
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,904
- Shoot him!
- Father! Commodore...

216
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:14,990
...do you intend to kill my rescuer?

217
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:24,166
I believe thanks are in order.

218
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:31,631
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, did we?

219
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:32,966
Pirate?

220
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:35,510
Hang him.

221
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:38,346
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

222
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,932
Well, well.

223
00:17:40,975 --> 00:17:43,477
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

224
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:46,188
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

225
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:48,148
Well, I don't see your ship...

226
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:49,399
...captain.

227
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:51,818
I'm in the market, as it were.

228
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:53,862
He said he'd come to commandeer one.

229
00:17:53,946 --> 00:17:56,740
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his, sir.

230
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:03,330
No additional shots nor powder.

231
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,000
A compass that doesn't point north.

232
00:18:12,006 --> 00:18:14,674
And I half expected it
to be made from wood.

233
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:20,097
You are, without doubt,
the worst pirate I've heard of.

234
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,516
But you have heard of me.

235
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:27,479
Commodore, I really must protest!

236
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:29,689
Carefully, lieutenant.

237
00:18:29,732 --> 00:18:32,025
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!

238
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:35,654
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness!

239
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:37,447
But it seems enough to condemn him.

240
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:38,865
Indeed.

241
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:41,785
Finally.

242
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:44,538
Wait, don't shoot!

243
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,914
I knew you'd warm up to me.

244
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:48,792
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please.

245
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:50,544
And my hat.

246
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:52,504
Commodore.

247
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:58,426
- Elizabeth. It is Elizabeth, isn't it?
- It's Miss Swann.

248
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:01,054
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.

249
00:19:01,097 --> 00:19:03,723
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

250
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:06,476
Now, if you'll be very kind.

251
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:24,911
Easy on the goods, darling.

252
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,789
You're despicable.

253
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:29,875
Sticks and stones, love.

254
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:31,501
I saved your life, you save mine.

255
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:32,586
We're square.

256
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:34,796
Gentlemen...

257
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:36,339
...my lady...

258
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:39,759
...you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

259
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:42,262
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

260
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:02,324
Now, will you shoot him?

261
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:04,075
Open fire!

262
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,792
Burn his heels!

263
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,227
Take cover, men!

264
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:32,229
Gillette...

265
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:35,148
...Mr Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows.

266
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:37,525
I would hate for him to miss it.

267
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,948
Search upstairs!

268
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:45,492
Look lively, men!

269
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:20,879
Right where I left you.

270
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:29,262
Not where I left you.

271
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:41,691
You're the one they're hunting.

272
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:43,860
The pirate!

273
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:47,739
You seem somewhat familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

274
00:22:47,782 --> 00:22:50,533
I make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

275
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:54,287
It would be a shame to put
a black mark on your record.

276
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,872
So if you'll excuse me...

277
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,544
Do you think this wise, boy?

278
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:05,673
Crossing blades with a pirate?

279
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:07,133
You threatened Miss Swann.

280
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:11,513
Only a little.

281
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:28,279
You know what you're doing,
I'll give you that. Excellent form.

282
00:23:29,156 --> 00:23:30,865
But how's your footwork?

283
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,034
If I step here...

284
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,829
Very good.

285
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:37,956
And now I step again.

286
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,003
Ta.

287
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:05,567
That is a wonderful trick.

288
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:10,530
Except, once again,
you are between me and my way out.

289
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:11,739
And now...

290
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:13,783
...you have no weapon.

291
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,765
Who makes all these?

292
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:40,560
I do.

293
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:42,896
And I practice with them...

294
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:44,564
...three hours a day.

295
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,568
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

296
00:24:55,242 --> 00:24:58,203
Or... perhaps the reason
you practice three hours a day

297
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:00,079
is that you already found one,

298
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:03,750
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

299
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,294
You're not a eunuch, are you?

300
00:25:06,378 --> 00:25:09,297
I practice three hours a day
so that when I meet a pirate,

301
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:10,757
I can kill him!

302
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:29,127
You cheated.

303
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:30,461
Pirate.

304
00:26:34,008 --> 00:26:36,009
- Move away!
- No.

305
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:37,427
Please move?

306
00:26:37,511 --> 00:26:38,511
No!

307
00:26:38,554 --> 00:26:41,347
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

308
00:26:43,892 --> 00:26:45,893
This shot is not meant for you.

309
00:26:56,238 --> 00:26:58,239
There he is! Over here!

310
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:02,201
Excellent work, Mr Brown.

311
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:06,080
You've assisted in the capture
of a dangerous fugitive.

312
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:08,458
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

313
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,045
I trust you will always remember
that this is the day

314
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:15,548
Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

315
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:17,342
Take him away.

316
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:24,557
- Come here, boy!
- Smell it?

317
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,685
- Come here, boy!
- You want a nice, juicy bone?

318
00:27:27,728 --> 00:27:30,146
- Hey!
- Come here, boy!

319
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,732
- Come here, boy!
- You can keep doing that forever.

320
00:27:32,816 --> 00:27:35,026
The dog is never going to move.

321
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:39,364
Well, excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet!

322
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:41,824
Come on!

323
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,372
There you go, miss.

324
00:27:47,414 --> 00:27:50,208
It was a difficult day for you,
I'm sure.

325
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,919
I suspected Commodore Norrington
would propose,

326
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:55,588
but I must admit,
I wasn't entirely prepared for it.

327
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,924
I meant you being
threatened by that pirate!

328
00:27:57,966 --> 00:27:59,217
Sounds terrifying!

329
00:27:59,968 --> 00:28:02,720
Oh... Yes, it was terrifying.

330
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:04,764
But... the Commodore proposed!

331
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:06,432
Fancy that.

332
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:08,101
Now that's a smart match, miss,

333
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:10,311
if it's not too bold to say.

334
00:28:10,396 --> 00:28:11,771
It is a smart match.

335
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,732
He's a fine man.

336
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:18,528
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

337
00:28:19,613 --> 00:28:21,739
Well, that Will Turner,

338
00:28:21,782 --> 00:28:23,950
he's a fine man, too.

339
00:28:23,992 --> 00:28:25,785
That is too bold.

340
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:27,954
Well, beggin' your pardon, miss.

341
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:29,664
It was not my place.

342
00:29:18,714 --> 00:29:21,716
Has my daughter given
you an answer yet?

343
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,509
No, she hasn't.

344
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:25,887
Well, she has had a very trying day.

345
00:29:27,556 --> 00:29:29,724
Ghastly weather, don't you think?

346
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:31,684
Bleak. Really bleak.

347
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:34,479
What's that?

348
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:37,440
Cannon fire!

349
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:40,693
Return fire!

350
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,487
I know those guns!

351
00:29:48,744 --> 00:29:50,745
It's the Pearl!

352
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:52,538
Black Pearl?

353
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:56,667
I've heard stories.

354
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,713
She's been preying on ships and
settlements for near ten years.

355
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:02,381
Never leaves any survivors.

356
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:03,883
No survivors.

357
00:30:03,926 --> 00:30:06,761
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

358
00:30:16,063 --> 00:30:17,814
Clear the dock!

359
00:30:39,628 --> 00:30:41,254
On your oars!

360
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:41,063
Sight the muzzle flash.

361
00:31:41,148 --> 00:31:42,148
Aim for the flashes.

362
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:44,317
I need a full spread, fore and aft.

363
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,027
Mr Stevens, more cartridges!

364
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:50,031
Governor!
Barricade yourself in my office.

365
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:51,991
Good God!

366
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:53,659
That's an order.

367
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:12,887
Don't!

368
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,847
Hello, chum.

369
00:32:19,102 --> 00:32:20,645
Up there! Go!

370
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:33,115
Miss! They've come to kidnap you!

371
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,785
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!

372
00:32:35,869 --> 00:32:37,036
In here!

373
00:32:38,705 --> 00:32:42,959
They haven't seen you. Hide, and the
first chance you get, run to the fort!

374
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:54,095
Got ya! Haven't I?

375
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:01,143
No! No! It's hot!

376
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:03,062
- I'm burning!
- Come on!

377
00:33:07,526 --> 00:33:08,859
Come on, me lads!

378
00:33:35,595 --> 00:33:37,430
Come out!

379
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:49,859
We know you're here, poppet.

380
00:33:50,944 --> 00:33:52,111
Poppet.

381
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:53,237
Come out...

382
00:33:54,156 --> 00:33:56,365
...and we promise we won't hurt you.

383
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,700
Eh?

384
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:01,454
We will find you, poppet.

385
00:34:02,497 --> 00:34:04,915
You've got something of ours,

386
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:06,751
and it calls to us.

387
00:34:12,466 --> 00:34:14,967
The gold calls to us.

388
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:17,178
The gold.

389
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,352
Hello, poppet.

390
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:26,896
Parley!

391
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:28,814
What?

392
00:34:28,857 --> 00:34:30,024
Parley.

393
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:31,525
I invoke the right of parley.

394
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,529
According to the code of brethren, set
down by pirates Morgan and Bartholomew,

395
00:34:35,614 --> 00:34:38,699
- you have to take me to your captain.
- I know the code.

396
00:34:38,784 --> 00:34:41,494
If an adversary demands parley,
you can do them no harm

397
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,330
- until the parley is complete.
- To blazes with the code!

398
00:34:44,414 --> 00:34:46,373
She wants to be taken to the captain.

399
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:50,169
And she'll go, without a fuss.

400
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:54,256
We must honour the code.

401
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:06,268
Say goodbye!

402
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:12,233
Goodbye.

403
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:18,155
- Come on!
- Elizabeth!

404
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:20,783
Well!

405
00:35:27,582 --> 00:35:29,166
Out of my way, scum!

406
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:44,682
My sympathies, friend.
You've no manner of luck at all.

407
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:08,581
Come on, doggy!

408
00:36:08,623 --> 00:36:10,499
It's just you and me now.

409
00:36:10,584 --> 00:36:12,960
It's you and old Jack.
Come on.

410
00:36:13,044 --> 00:36:14,753
Come on. That's a boy!

411
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:16,964
Good boy. Come get your bone!

412
00:36:17,048 --> 00:36:19,842
That's a good boy.
Come on, a bit closer, a bit closer.

413
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:23,053
That's it! That's it, doggy!

414
00:36:23,096 --> 00:36:27,099
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy cur!

415
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:29,435
Don't do that. No, no, no!

416
00:36:29,477 --> 00:36:31,145
I didn't mean it! I didn't...

417
00:36:38,028 --> 00:36:39,570
This ain't the armoury!

418
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:42,489
Well, well, well.

419
00:36:42,574 --> 00:36:45,451
Look what we have here, Twigg.

420
00:36:45,535 --> 00:36:47,620
Captain Jack Sparrow.

421
00:36:48,788 --> 00:36:50,956
Last time I saw you,

422
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:52,791
you were all alone

423
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:55,628
on a godforsaken island,

424
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,880
shrinking into the distance.

425
00:36:57,964 --> 00:37:00,466
His fortunes aren't improved much.

426
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,969
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

427
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:07,056
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers

428
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,682
and mutineers.

429
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:14,313
So there is a curse.

430
00:37:16,024 --> 00:37:17,399
That's interesting.

431
00:37:17,484 --> 00:37:19,735
You know nothing of hell.

432
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:30,412
That's very interesting.

433
00:38:05,865 --> 00:38:08,409
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.

434
00:38:08,493 --> 00:38:11,537
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

435
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:15,457
- I am here to negotia...
- You will speak when spoken to!

436
00:38:16,459 --> 00:38:18,544
And ye will not lay a hand on those

437
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:21,005
under the protection of parley.

438
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:22,798
Aye, sir.

439
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,428
My apologies, miss.

440
00:38:28,513 --> 00:38:29,847
Captain Barbossa,

441
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:34,310
I am here to negotiate the cessation
of hostilities against Port Royal.

442
00:38:35,395 --> 00:38:39,440
A lot of long words in there, miss.
We are not but humble pirates.

443
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:42,109
What is it that you want?

444
00:38:42,193 --> 00:38:44,320
I want you to leave and never come back.

445
00:38:46,948 --> 00:38:49,575
I'm disinclined
to acquiesce to your request.

446
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:53,495
Means "no."

447
00:38:54,914 --> 00:38:55,914
Very well.

448
00:38:58,626 --> 00:39:00,586
I'll drop it.

449
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:08,802
Me holds are burstin' with swag!
That bit of shine matters to us?

450
00:39:09,304 --> 00:39:10,304
Why?

451
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:13,724
It's what you've been searching for.

452
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:15,434
I recognise the ship.

453
00:39:15,518 --> 00:39:18,395
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!

454
00:39:18,438 --> 00:39:19,605
Did you now?

455
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:23,609
Fine.

456
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:26,195
I suppose if it is worthless,

457
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:28,322
then there's no point in me keeping it.

458
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:29,448
No!

459
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:42,461
You have a name, missy?

460
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:44,630
Elizabeth...

461
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:46,048
...Turner.

462
00:39:47,175 --> 00:39:49,259
I'm a maid in the governor's household.

463
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:53,972
Miss Turner!

464
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:56,433
Turner!

465
00:39:56,476 --> 00:39:57,893
Bootstrap!

466
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,608
And how does a maid come
to own a trinket such as that?

467
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:07,277
Family heirloom, perhaps?

468
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,822
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

469
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:14,493
Very well. You hand it over,
we'll put your town to our rudder,

470
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:15,786
and ne'er return.

471
00:40:29,509 --> 00:40:30,509
Our bargain?

472
00:40:33,513 --> 00:40:35,347
Still the guns and stow 'em.

473
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,225
Signal the men, set the flags
and make good to clear port.

474
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:40,018
Wait! You have to take me to shore.

475
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:42,688
According to the code of
the order of the brethren...

476
00:40:42,772 --> 00:40:46,442
Your return to shore was not part of
our negotiation nor our agreements,

477
00:40:46,526 --> 00:40:47,693
so I must do nothin'.

478
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:50,863
Secondly, you must be a pirate
for the pirate's code to apply,

479
00:40:50,905 --> 00:40:52,531
and you're not, and thirdly...

480
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:55,325
...the code is more of what
you'd call a guideline,

481
00:40:55,368 --> 00:40:56,869
instead of actual rules.

482
00:40:56,911 --> 00:40:59,329
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,

483
00:40:59,372 --> 00:41:00,873
Miss Turner.

484
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:23,979
They've taken her!
They've taken Elizabeth!

485
00:41:24,063 --> 00:41:26,148
Mr Murtogg, remove this man.

486
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:29,318
We have to hunt them down!
We must save her!

487
00:41:29,402 --> 00:41:31,445
And where do you propose we start?

488
00:41:32,697 --> 00:41:36,366
If you have any information concerning
my daughter, please share it.

489
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:40,412
That Jack Sparrow!

490
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:42,748
He talked about the Black Pearl.

491
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,708
Mentioned it is more what he did.

492
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:49,421
Ask him where it is! Make a deal
with him, he could lead us to it.

493
00:41:49,464 --> 00:41:50,964
No.

494
00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:54,343
The pirates who invaded this fort
left Sparrow locked in his cell,

495
00:41:54,427 --> 00:41:57,429
ergo they are not his allies.

496
00:41:57,472 --> 00:42:00,474
Governor, we will establish
their most likely course...

497
00:42:00,558 --> 00:42:02,434
That's not good enough!

498
00:42:02,477 --> 00:42:04,436
Mr Turner...

499
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:08,023
...you are not a military man,
you are not a sailor.

500
00:42:09,067 --> 00:42:10,442
You are a blacksmith.

501
00:42:10,485 --> 00:42:13,320
And this is not the moment
for rash actions!

502
00:42:15,615 --> 00:42:18,617
Do not make the mistake of thinking
you are the only man here

503
00:42:18,701 --> 00:42:20,202
who cares for Elizabeth.

504
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:27,417
Please...

505
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,549
You! Sparrow!

506
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:34,633
Aye?

507
00:42:34,676 --> 00:42:37,302
You are familiar with that ship,
the Black Pearl?

508
00:42:37,345 --> 00:42:38,720
I've heard of it.

509
00:42:38,805 --> 00:42:41,473
Where does it make berth?

510
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:44,434
Have you not heard the stories?

511
00:42:46,145 --> 00:42:48,105
Captain Barbossa

512
00:42:48,147 --> 00:42:49,898
and his crew of miscreants

513
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,568
sail from the dreaded Isla de Muerte.

514
00:42:52,652 --> 00:42:55,445
It's an island that
cannot be found, except

515
00:42:55,488 --> 00:42:58,574
by those who already know where it is.

516
00:42:58,658 --> 00:43:00,325
The ship's real enough,

517
00:43:00,368 --> 00:43:03,829
therefore its anchorage must be
a real place. Where is it?

518
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,998
Why ask me?

519
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,250
Because you're a pirate.

520
00:43:08,334 --> 00:43:11,003
And you want to turn pirate yourself.
Is that it?

521
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,255
Never!

522
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,677
They took Miss Swann.

523
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,554
So it is that you found a girl!

524
00:43:20,638 --> 00:43:22,431
I see.

525
00:43:22,515 --> 00:43:25,267
If you're intending to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

526
00:43:25,351 --> 00:43:27,311
and so, win fair lady's heart...

527
00:43:27,353 --> 00:43:29,980
...you'll have to do it alone, mate.

528
00:43:30,023 --> 00:43:32,107
I see no profit in it for me.

529
00:43:33,192 --> 00:43:34,443
I can get you out of here.

530
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,194
How's that? The key's run off.

531
00:43:36,237 --> 00:43:37,863
I helped build these cells.

532
00:43:37,947 --> 00:43:40,699
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

533
00:43:41,993 --> 00:43:45,287
With the right leverage,
and the proper application of strength,

534
00:43:46,414 --> 00:43:47,831
the door will lift free.

535
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:51,460
What's your name?

536
00:43:51,544 --> 00:43:53,462
Will Turner.

537
00:43:54,756 --> 00:43:57,090
That would be short for William,
I imagine.

538
00:43:57,175 --> 00:43:58,342
Good, strong name.

539
00:43:59,344 --> 00:44:01,261
No doubt named for your father?

540
00:44:03,014 --> 00:44:04,014
Yes.

541
00:44:06,851 --> 00:44:08,185
Well, Mr Turner,

542
00:44:08,227 --> 00:44:09,436
I've changed me mind.

543
00:44:10,104 --> 00:44:13,106
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear, on pain of death,

544
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:15,400
I shall take you to the Black Pearl,

545
00:44:15,443 --> 00:44:17,110
and your bonny lass.

546
00:44:17,195 --> 00:44:19,196
Do we have an accord?

547
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,534
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

548
00:44:24,577 --> 00:44:25,744
Get me out.

549
00:44:29,248 --> 00:44:33,043
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

550
00:44:39,634 --> 00:44:41,134
We're going to steal the ship?

551
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:43,929
That ship?

552
00:44:44,013 --> 00:44:45,847
Commandeer.

553
00:44:45,932 --> 00:44:48,183
We're going to commandeer that ship.

554
00:44:48,267 --> 00:44:49,351
Nautical term.

555
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:52,104
One question about your business, boy,

556
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:53,605
or there's no use going.

557
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,190
This girl...

558
00:44:55,274 --> 00:44:57,984
...how far are you willing to go
to save her?

559
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:59,403
I'd die for her.

560
00:44:59,445 --> 00:45:00,654
Oh, good.

561
00:45:00,738 --> 00:45:02,739
No worries then.

562
00:45:21,759 --> 00:45:24,302
This is either madness or brilliance.

563
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:28,724
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

564
00:45:58,379 --> 00:46:02,174
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.

565
00:46:02,258 --> 00:46:03,967
Aye! Avast!

566
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,514
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.

567
00:46:10,391 --> 00:46:12,184
You'll never make it out of the bay.

568
00:46:12,226 --> 00:46:13,852
Son...

569
00:46:14,896 --> 00:46:17,731
...I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

570
00:46:17,815 --> 00:46:19,357
Savvy?

571
00:46:22,862 --> 00:46:23,904
Commodore!

572
00:46:23,988 --> 00:46:26,198
Sir! They're taking the Dauntless!

573
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:29,284
Commodore!

574
00:46:29,368 --> 00:46:31,703
They're taking the ship!

575
00:46:32,455 --> 00:46:35,081
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!

576
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:36,500
Rash, Turner.

577
00:46:36,542 --> 00:46:38,210
Too rash.

578
00:46:39,754 --> 00:46:43,965
He is, without doubt,
the worst pirate I have ever seen.

579
00:46:47,261 --> 00:46:48,553
Here they come.

580
00:46:53,392 --> 00:46:55,644
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

581
00:47:02,193 --> 00:47:05,362
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

582
00:47:21,379 --> 00:47:24,256
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!
Now!

583
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:34,182
Thank you, Commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

584
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:36,852
We'd have had a hard time
of it by ourselves.

585
00:47:40,106 --> 00:47:42,148
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

586
00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:44,776
With the wind a quarter astern,
we won't catch them!

587
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:47,779
I don't need to. Just get them
in range of the long nines.

588
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:49,948
Hands, come about! Run out the guns!

589
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:51,366
Bring out the guns!

590
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,035
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

591
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,956
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

592
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,458
Commodore!

593
00:48:00,501 --> 00:48:02,586
He's disabled the rudder chain, sir.

594
00:48:06,299 --> 00:48:07,966
Abandon ship!

595
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,100
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

596
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:20,937
So it would seem.

597
00:48:29,572 --> 00:48:31,448
When I was a lad, living in England,

598
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:33,450
my mother raised me by herself.

599
00:48:33,534 --> 00:48:35,493
After she died, I came out here,

600
00:48:35,578 --> 00:48:37,412
looking for my father.

601
00:48:38,873 --> 00:48:39,998
Is that so?

602
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:42,751
My father,

603
00:48:42,835 --> 00:48:44,210
Bill Turner?

604
00:48:44,295 --> 00:48:47,881
At the jail, it was only after you
learned my name that you agreed to help.

605
00:48:47,965 --> 00:48:50,675
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

606
00:48:50,718 --> 00:48:52,302
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

607
00:48:52,345 --> 00:48:54,346
You knew my father.

608
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:01,561
I knew him.

609
00:49:01,646 --> 00:49:04,564
Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

610
00:49:04,649 --> 00:49:08,068
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap," or "Bootstrap Bill."

611
00:49:08,152 --> 00:49:09,152
Bootstrap?

612
00:49:10,154 --> 00:49:12,572
Good man.
Good pirate.

613
00:49:12,657 --> 00:49:14,741
I swear, you look just like him.

614
00:49:14,825 --> 00:49:15,867
It's not true.

615
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,702
He was a merchant sailor.

616
00:49:17,787 --> 00:49:20,038
A good, respectable man
who obeyed the law.

617
00:49:20,122 --> 00:49:22,290
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

618
00:49:23,668 --> 00:49:26,378
My father was not a pirate!

619
00:49:27,546 --> 00:49:29,547
Put it away, son.

620
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:31,549
It's not worth you getting beat again.

621
00:49:31,634 --> 00:49:32,759
You didn't beat me.

622
00:49:32,843 --> 00:49:36,179
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

623
00:49:36,222 --> 00:49:39,057
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

624
00:49:46,399 --> 00:49:49,651
Now as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

625
00:49:49,735 --> 00:49:52,237
The only rules
that really matter are these:

626
00:49:52,321 --> 00:49:56,199
What a man can do,
and what a man can't do.

627
00:49:56,909 --> 00:49:58,076
For instance,

628
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,287
you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man,

629
00:50:01,372 --> 00:50:02,414
or you can't.

630
00:50:02,456 --> 00:50:06,001
Pirate is in your blood, boy, so
you'll have to square with that someday.

631
00:50:06,877 --> 00:50:09,045
Now, me, for example.
I could let you drown,

632
00:50:09,088 --> 00:50:13,591
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies. Savvy?

633
00:50:13,926 --> 00:50:14,926
So...

634
00:50:19,974 --> 00:50:23,309
Can you sail under
the command of a pirate?

635
00:50:24,562 --> 00:50:25,895
Or can you not?

636
00:50:28,607 --> 00:50:29,649
Tortuga?

637
00:50:29,734 --> 00:50:31,484
Tortuga.

638
00:50:53,549 --> 00:50:57,886
More importantly, it is indeed
a sad life that has never breathed deep

639
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:01,139
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

640
00:51:02,892 --> 00:51:04,017
What do you think?

641
00:51:08,314 --> 00:51:09,397
It'll linger.

642
00:51:09,482 --> 00:51:13,485
I'll tell you, mate, if every town
in the world were like this one,

643
00:51:13,569 --> 00:51:16,029
no man would ever feel unwanted.

644
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:19,074
Scarlett!

645
00:51:20,993 --> 00:51:22,327
Not sure I deserved that.

646
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:25,288
Giselle!

647
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:26,331
Who was she?

648
00:51:26,415 --> 00:51:27,415
What?

649
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,002
I may have deserved that.

650
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:36,382
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

651
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:40,845
Mother's love!

652
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:41,930
Jack!

653
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:46,059
You should know better than to
wake a man when he's sleepin'.

654
00:51:46,143 --> 00:51:50,021
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

655
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:53,399
The man who did the waking buys
the man who was sleeping a drink,

656
00:51:53,484 --> 00:51:56,903
and the man who was sleeping drinks
while listening to a proposition

657
00:51:56,987 --> 00:51:58,696
from the man who did the waking.

658
00:52:00,866 --> 00:52:02,700
Aye, that'll about do it.

659
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,791
Blast! I'm already awake!

660
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:11,251
That was for the smell.

661
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,221
Keep a sharp eye.

662
00:52:30,354 --> 00:52:31,437
Now...

663
00:52:31,522 --> 00:52:33,982
...what's the nature
of this venture of you'rn?

664
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:37,902
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

665
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,241
I know where it's going to be,

666
00:52:43,284 --> 00:52:45,076
and I'm gonna take it.

667
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,120
Jack,

668
00:52:47,204 --> 00:52:49,497
it's a fool's errand!

669
00:52:49,582 --> 00:52:52,917
Well, you know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl!

670
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,086
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

671
00:52:56,088 --> 00:52:57,422
All I need is a crew.

672
00:52:58,132 --> 00:53:00,133
What I hear tell of Captain Barbossa,

673
00:53:00,217 --> 00:53:03,219
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one!

674
00:53:03,262 --> 00:53:05,513
I'd say it's a good thing
I'm not a fool, then.

675
00:53:05,598 --> 00:53:06,681
Prove me wrong!

676
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:10,685
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

677
00:53:10,769 --> 00:53:14,105
Let's just say
it's a matter of leverage, eh?

678
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:31,331
The kid?

679
00:53:32,917 --> 00:53:35,919
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

680
00:53:37,004 --> 00:53:39,464
His only child. Savvy?

681
00:53:39,548 --> 00:53:41,466
Is he now?

682
00:53:44,428 --> 00:53:46,804
Leverage, says you.

683
00:53:46,889 --> 00:53:49,849
I think I feel
a change in the wind, says I.

684
00:53:49,934 --> 00:53:51,309
I'll find us a crew.

685
00:53:51,352 --> 00:53:54,312
There's bound to be some sailors
on this rock, crazy as you.

686
00:53:54,355 --> 00:53:56,689
One can only hope.

687
00:53:56,774 --> 00:53:59,525
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

688
00:54:24,385 --> 00:54:26,177
You'll be dining with the captain,

689
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,596
and he requests you wear this.

690
00:54:29,556 --> 00:54:33,184
Tell the captain I'm "disinclined
to acquiesce to his request."

691
00:54:34,311 --> 00:54:36,562
He said you'd say that.

692
00:54:36,647 --> 00:54:39,023
He also said, if that be the case...

693
00:54:39,108 --> 00:54:40,858
...you'll be dining with the crew,

694
00:54:40,901 --> 00:54:42,443
and you'll be naked.

695
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:50,285
Fine.

696
00:55:06,927 --> 00:55:10,513
There's no need to stand on ceremony
no call to impress anyone.

697
00:55:10,556 --> 00:55:12,932
You must be hungry.

698
00:55:30,367 --> 00:55:31,576
Try the wine.

699
00:55:36,415 --> 00:55:39,417
And the apples. One of those next.

700
00:55:47,718 --> 00:55:49,385
It's poisoned.

701
00:55:50,929 --> 00:55:53,264
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

702
00:55:53,307 --> 00:55:56,768
Then release me. You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.

703
00:56:00,773 --> 00:56:02,815
You don't know what this is,

704
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,275
do you?

705
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,611
It's a pirate medallion.

706
00:56:06,653 --> 00:56:08,738
This is Aztec gold.

707
00:56:09,615 --> 00:56:12,408
One of 882 identical pieces

708
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:16,037
they delivered in a stone chest
to Cortés himself.

709
00:56:17,122 --> 00:56:21,334
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

710
00:56:21,418 --> 00:56:25,254
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

711
00:56:25,297 --> 00:56:28,800
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

712
00:56:30,677 --> 00:56:32,303
...a terrible curse.

713
00:56:33,931 --> 00:56:38,184
Any mortal that removes but
a single piece from that stone chest...

714
00:56:39,186 --> 00:56:41,646
...shall be punished for eternity.

715
00:56:43,982 --> 00:56:47,360
I hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

716
00:56:47,486 --> 00:56:48,653
Aye.

717
00:56:49,488 --> 00:56:52,990
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

718
00:56:53,033 --> 00:56:55,952
Buried on an Isle of the Dead
what cannot be found,

719
00:56:55,994 --> 00:56:57,870
except for those who know where it is.

720
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:00,915
Find it, we did.

721
00:57:02,584 --> 00:57:03,918
There be the chest.

722
00:57:04,002 --> 00:57:05,795
Inside be the gold.

723
00:57:06,755 --> 00:57:09,173
And we took 'em all!

724
00:57:09,216 --> 00:57:11,217
We spent 'em and traded 'em,

725
00:57:11,301 --> 00:57:12,969
and frittered 'em away

726
00:57:13,011 --> 00:57:15,763
on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

727
00:57:15,848 --> 00:57:17,849
The more we gave 'em away,

728
00:57:17,891 --> 00:57:20,560
the more we came to realise...

729
00:57:21,854 --> 00:57:24,021
...the drink would not satisfy.

730
00:57:25,274 --> 00:57:28,025
Food turned to ash in our mouths...

731
00:57:28,694 --> 00:57:31,279
...and all the pleasurable company
in the world

732
00:57:31,363 --> 00:57:33,364
could not slake our lust.

733
00:57:35,242 --> 00:57:38,035
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

734
00:57:39,788 --> 00:57:42,457
Compelled by greed we were, but now...

735
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:45,877
...we are consumed by it.

736
00:57:57,055 --> 00:57:59,974
There is one way we can end our curse.

737
00:58:04,062 --> 00:58:07,023
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold

738
00:58:07,065 --> 00:58:08,483
must be restored,

739
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:10,985
and the blood repaid.

740
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:15,114
Thanks to ye,

741
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:17,325
we have the final piece.

742
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:21,662
And the... blood to be repaid?

743
00:58:21,747 --> 00:58:24,248
That's why there's no sense
to be killing ya.

744
00:58:25,042 --> 00:58:26,042
Yet.

745
00:58:28,086 --> 00:58:29,587
Apple?

746
00:58:38,138 --> 00:58:39,138
Let me go!

747
00:58:46,438 --> 00:58:47,438
I'm curious.

748
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:50,441
After killing me, what is it
you're planning on doing next?

749
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,215
Look!

750
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,218
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

751
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:03,264
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

752
01:00:03,348 --> 01:00:05,016
But neither are we dead.

753
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:10,062
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

754
01:00:10,147 --> 01:00:12,523
Too long I've been starvin' to death,

755
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:14,233
and haven't died!

756
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,652
I feel nothing.

757
01:00:17,446 --> 01:00:20,364
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

758
01:00:21,783 --> 01:00:23,951
...nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

759
01:00:24,953 --> 01:00:29,457
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

760
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:30,541
You're in one!

761
01:00:49,603 --> 01:00:51,562
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

762
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:02,448
Feast your eyes, captain.

763
01:01:02,532 --> 01:01:05,451
All of them,
faithful hands before the mast.

764
01:01:05,535 --> 01:01:08,746
Every man worth his salt...

765
01:01:08,789 --> 01:01:10,831
...and crazy to boot.

766
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:13,751
So this is your able-bodied crew?

767
01:01:19,591 --> 01:01:20,591
You, sailor!

768
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:22,051
Cotton, sir.

769
01:01:22,094 --> 01:01:23,886
Mr Cotton.

770
01:01:23,929 --> 01:01:27,264
Do you have the courage and fortitude
to follow orders and stay true

771
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:28,933
in the face of danger and death?

772
01:01:28,975 --> 01:01:30,685
Mr Cotton!

773
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:31,894
Answer, man!

774
01:01:31,937 --> 01:01:33,354
He's a mute, sir.

775
01:01:33,438 --> 01:01:35,147
Poor devil had his tongue cut out.

776
01:01:35,232 --> 01:01:37,274
So he trained the parrot
to talk for him.

777
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:39,235
No one's yet figured how.

778
01:01:42,447 --> 01:01:44,073
Mr Cotton's parrot.

779
01:01:45,075 --> 01:01:46,575
Same question.

780
01:01:46,618 --> 01:01:49,370
When do you sail?
When do you sail?

781
01:01:50,497 --> 01:01:52,581
Mostly, we figure that means "yes."

782
01:01:52,624 --> 01:01:54,125
Of course it does.

783
01:01:54,209 --> 01:01:55,209
Satisfied?

784
01:01:56,169 --> 01:01:58,254
Well, you've proved they're mad!

785
01:01:58,296 --> 01:02:00,131
And what's the benefit for us?

786
01:02:10,642 --> 01:02:11,726
Anamaria!

787
01:02:13,645 --> 01:02:15,980
I suppose you didn't deserve
that one, either.

788
01:02:16,064 --> 01:02:17,982
No, that one I deserved.

789
01:02:18,024 --> 01:02:19,775
You stole my boat!

790
01:02:19,818 --> 01:02:20,901
Actually...

791
01:02:22,988 --> 01:02:25,364
Borrowed. Borrowed, without permission,

792
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:28,033
but with every intention
of bringing it back to you.

793
01:02:28,118 --> 01:02:29,535
But you didn't!

794
01:02:29,619 --> 01:02:30,995
You'll get another one!

795
01:02:32,372 --> 01:02:33,372
I will!

796
01:02:33,457 --> 01:02:34,457
A better one.

797
01:02:34,499 --> 01:02:35,958
A better one!

798
01:02:36,918 --> 01:02:38,502
- That one!
- What one?

799
01:02:41,214 --> 01:02:42,381
That one?

800
01:02:45,844 --> 01:02:47,553
Aye. That one.

801
01:02:47,637 --> 01:02:49,221
- What say you?
- Aye!

802
01:02:49,306 --> 01:02:50,681
Aye!

803
01:02:50,766 --> 01:02:51,766
Anchors away!

804
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:55,060
No, no, no, no, no!
It's frightful bad luck

805
01:02:55,145 --> 01:02:56,645
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

806
01:02:56,688 --> 01:02:59,356
It'll be far worse not to have her.

807
01:03:33,058 --> 01:03:36,101
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find,

808
01:03:36,186 --> 01:03:38,646
with a compass that doesn't work?

809
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,689
Aye, the compass doesn't point north,

810
01:03:40,732 --> 01:03:43,567
but we're not trying
to find north, are we?

811
01:03:54,246 --> 01:03:56,622
We should drop canvas, sir.

812
01:03:56,706 --> 01:03:58,749
She can hold a bit longer.

813
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:04,505
What's in your head that's put you
in such a fine mood, captain?

814
01:04:04,589 --> 01:04:06,590
We're catching up.

815
01:04:21,606 --> 01:04:23,607
Time to go, poppet.

816
01:05:19,164 --> 01:05:23,584
Dead men tell no tales...

817
01:05:26,129 --> 01:05:28,797
Puts a chill in the bones,
how many honest sailors

818
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,674
have been claimed by this passage.

819
01:05:46,149 --> 01:05:48,525
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

820
01:05:48,568 --> 01:05:51,779
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
'fore he showed up in Tortuga

821
01:05:51,863 --> 01:05:54,531
with a mind to go after
the treasure of Isla de Muerte.

822
01:05:54,616 --> 01:05:55,866
That was before I met him,

823
01:05:55,951 --> 01:05:58,118
back when he was captain
of the Black Pearl.

824
01:05:58,995 --> 01:05:59,995
What?

825
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:05,125
He failed to mention that.

826
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:07,461
He plays things closer to the vest now.

827
01:06:07,545 --> 01:06:09,630
And a hard-learned lesson it was.

828
01:06:09,714 --> 01:06:12,591
Three days before the venture,
the first mate comes says,

829
01:06:12,676 --> 01:06:15,761
"Everything's an equal share.
That should mean the location

830
01:06:15,845 --> 01:06:19,223
of the treasure, too,"
so Jack gives up the bearings.

831
01:06:19,391 --> 01:06:21,558
That night, there was a mutiny.

832
01:06:22,602 --> 01:06:25,270
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

833
01:06:25,355 --> 01:06:28,023
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

834
01:06:32,112 --> 01:06:34,530
So that's the reason for all the...

835
01:06:36,574 --> 01:06:38,283
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

836
01:06:39,244 --> 01:06:41,412
Now, Will, when a pirate's marooned,

837
01:06:41,496 --> 01:06:44,248
he's given a pistol with a single shot.
One shot...

838
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:47,626
Well, that won't do much good hunting,
nor to be rescued.

839
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:50,921
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

840
01:06:50,964 --> 01:06:54,341
that pistol starts to look
real friendly.

841
01:06:54,426 --> 01:06:56,427
But Jack, he escaped the island,

842
01:06:56,511 --> 01:06:58,095
and still has that single shot.

843
01:06:58,179 --> 01:07:00,764
He won't use it, though,
save on one man.

844
01:07:01,766 --> 01:07:03,809
His mutinous first mate.

845
01:07:03,893 --> 01:07:05,853
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

846
01:07:07,105 --> 01:07:10,065
- How did Jack get off the island?
- Well, I'll tell ye.

847
01:07:10,108 --> 01:07:12,234
He waded out into the shallows,

848
01:07:12,277 --> 01:07:14,862
and he waited there three days
and three nights,

849
01:07:14,946 --> 01:07:18,782
till all manner of sea creatures
came acclimated to his presence.

850
01:07:19,784 --> 01:07:21,326
And on the fourth morning,

851
01:07:21,411 --> 01:07:25,539
he roped a couple of sea turtles,
lashed them together and made a raft.

852
01:07:27,792 --> 01:07:30,210
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.

853
01:07:30,295 --> 01:07:31,587
Sea turtles!

854
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,841
What did he use for rope?

855
01:07:40,805 --> 01:07:42,389
Human hair.

856
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:44,808
From my back.

857
01:07:45,977 --> 01:07:47,352
Let go the anchor!

858
01:07:47,437 --> 01:07:49,813
Lower the anchor line!

859
01:07:49,898 --> 01:07:52,316
Young Mr Turner and I are to go ashore.

860
01:07:52,942 --> 01:07:54,068
Captain.

861
01:07:54,152 --> 01:07:55,861
What if the worst should happen?

862
01:07:56,738 --> 01:07:59,239
- Keep to the code.
- Aye. The code.

863
01:08:26,309 --> 01:08:28,310
Ten years of hoarding swag!

864
01:08:28,353 --> 01:08:30,854
And now we finally get to spend it!

865
01:08:38,196 --> 01:08:40,989
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men...

866
01:08:41,699 --> 01:08:45,410
...and you can buy an eye what
actually fits and is made of glass.

867
01:08:45,495 --> 01:08:48,413
This one does splinter
something terrible!

868
01:08:49,499 --> 01:08:50,707
Stop rubbing it!

869
01:09:10,353 --> 01:09:13,397
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

870
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:15,732
The pirates' code.

871
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:17,234
Any man who falls behind...

872
01:09:17,277 --> 01:09:19,611
...is left behind.

873
01:09:20,947 --> 01:09:23,240
No heroes amongst thieves.

874
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:27,035
You know, for having
such a bleak outlook on pirates,

875
01:09:27,078 --> 01:09:29,997
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

876
01:09:30,498 --> 01:09:32,082
Sprung a man from jail...

877
01:09:33,418 --> 01:09:35,919
...commandeered a ship of the fleet,

878
01:09:35,962 --> 01:09:38,505
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga...

879
01:09:40,675 --> 01:09:43,927
...and you're completely
obsessed with treasure!

880
01:09:46,681 --> 01:09:47,806
That's not true.

881
01:09:48,516 --> 01:09:50,267
I am not obsessed with treasure.

882
01:09:57,483 --> 01:10:00,235
Not all treasure
is silver and gold, mate.

883
01:10:00,278 --> 01:10:01,945
Gentlemen, the time has come!

884
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:03,614
Hurrah!

885
01:10:03,698 --> 01:10:05,824
Salvation is nigh!

886
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:07,326
Yeah!

887
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:10,120
- Our torment is nearing an end!
- Elizabeth.

888
01:10:11,331 --> 01:10:13,582
For ten years,
we've been tested and tried,

889
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:15,375
and each man-jack of you here

890
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:18,462
has proved his mettle 100 times over.

891
01:10:18,504 --> 01:10:20,797
And 100 times again!

892
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:21,840
Yeah!

893
01:10:22,967 --> 01:10:24,551
Suffered, I have!

894
01:10:25,303 --> 01:10:27,137
Punished, we were,

895
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,722
the lot of us,

896
01:10:28,806 --> 01:10:32,142
disproportionate to our crime!

897
01:10:32,227 --> 01:10:34,019
Right!

898
01:10:34,103 --> 01:10:35,312
Here it is!

899
01:10:38,983 --> 01:10:42,611
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

900
01:10:44,614 --> 01:10:47,157
Every last piece that went astray,

901
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,951
we have returned.

902
01:10:48,993 --> 01:10:50,702
Save for this!

903
01:10:50,787 --> 01:10:52,204
- Yeah!
- Jack!

904
01:10:52,288 --> 01:10:54,915
Not yet!

905
01:10:54,999 --> 01:10:57,501
We'll wait for the opportune moment.

906
01:10:57,585 --> 01:11:00,337
...despairing
of ever finding the lass.

907
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:02,214
When's that?

908
01:11:02,298 --> 01:11:05,008
When it's of greatest profit to you?

909
01:11:05,051 --> 01:11:06,385
May I ask you something?

910
01:11:07,762 --> 01:11:10,097
Have I ever given you
reason not to trust me?

911
01:11:11,474 --> 01:11:12,474
Do us a favour.

912
01:11:12,517 --> 01:11:14,643
I know it's difficult for you,

913
01:11:14,686 --> 01:11:16,728
but please, stay here,

914
01:11:16,813 --> 01:11:19,690
and try not to do anything stupid.

915
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,861
And who among us
has paid the blood sacrifice

916
01:11:24,946 --> 01:11:27,197
- owed to the heathen gods?
- Aye!

917
01:11:27,282 --> 01:11:30,117
And whose blood must yet be paid?

918
01:11:30,201 --> 01:11:31,868
Hers!

919
01:11:34,038 --> 01:11:38,625
You know the first thing I'm going
to do after the curse is lifted?

920
01:11:40,962 --> 01:11:44,298
Eat a whole bushel of apples!

921
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,141
Begun by blood,

922
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:56,226
by blood undone.

923
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:01,732
Sorry, Jack.

924
01:12:01,816 --> 01:12:04,359
I'm not going to be your leverage.

925
01:12:13,578 --> 01:12:15,746
That's it?

926
01:12:15,788 --> 01:12:17,456
Waste not.

927
01:12:55,453 --> 01:12:56,787
Did it work?

928
01:12:56,829 --> 01:12:59,706
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

929
01:13:06,798 --> 01:13:08,298
You're not dead!

930
01:13:09,342 --> 01:13:10,967
No.

931
01:13:11,928 --> 01:13:13,261
He shot me!

932
01:13:13,304 --> 01:13:14,805
It didn't work!

933
01:13:14,889 --> 01:13:16,848
The curse is still upon us!

934
01:13:21,938 --> 01:13:24,398
You! Maid! Your father,
what was his name?

935
01:13:24,482 --> 01:13:26,733
Was your father William Turner?

936
01:13:27,068 --> 01:13:28,318
No.

937
01:13:28,361 --> 01:13:31,863
Where's his child? The child that sailed
from England eight years ago?

938
01:13:31,948 --> 01:13:34,658
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

939
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,700
Where?

940
01:13:42,708 --> 01:13:44,000
You two!

941
01:13:45,002 --> 01:13:47,087
- You brought us the wrong person!
- Yeah!

942
01:13:48,047 --> 01:13:49,047
No!

943
01:13:49,799 --> 01:13:52,592
She had the medallion!
She's the proper age!

944
01:13:52,677 --> 01:13:54,845
She said her name was Turner.
You heard her!

945
01:13:57,098 --> 01:13:58,181
I think she lied to us!

946
01:13:58,224 --> 01:13:59,224
Yeah!

947
01:14:01,018 --> 01:14:03,353
You brought us here for nothing!

948
01:14:03,396 --> 01:14:07,524
I won't take questionin' or
second-guessin' from you, Mr Twigg!

949
01:14:07,608 --> 01:14:08,859
Who's to blame him?

950
01:14:08,901 --> 01:14:11,862
Every decision you've made
has led us from bad to worse!

951
01:14:14,073 --> 01:14:16,658
It was you who sent
Bootstrap to the depths!

952
01:14:16,701 --> 01:14:17,701
Yeah!

953
01:14:20,496 --> 01:14:23,081
And it's you who brought us
here in the first place!

954
01:14:24,876 --> 01:14:27,544
If any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

955
01:14:29,839 --> 01:14:31,756
I say, we cut her throat,

956
01:14:31,841 --> 01:14:33,467
and spill all her blood!

957
01:14:33,551 --> 01:14:34,551
Just in case.

958
01:14:34,594 --> 01:14:35,594
Yeah!

959
01:14:44,687 --> 01:14:45,896
The medallion!

960
01:14:45,938 --> 01:14:47,272
She's taken it!

961
01:14:47,356 --> 01:14:51,818
Get after her,
you feckless pack of ingrates!

962
01:14:57,366 --> 01:15:00,368
- Where's the oars?
- There's no oars!

963
01:15:00,411 --> 01:15:03,246
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!

964
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,340
You!

965
01:15:15,426 --> 01:15:17,093
You're supposed to be dead!

966
01:15:17,136 --> 01:15:18,470
Am I not?

967
01:15:37,907 --> 01:15:40,659
...parsnip... pars-ley...

968
01:15:40,743 --> 01:15:42,744
...Partner, pardoner...

969
01:15:42,787 --> 01:15:43,787
Parley?

970
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:45,705
That's the one! Parley!

971
01:15:46,457 --> 01:15:47,457
Parley!

972
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,792
Parley?!

973
01:15:50,044 --> 01:15:53,838
Damned to the depths whatever
madman thought of parley!

974
01:15:55,466 --> 01:15:57,759
That would be the French.

975
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:10,772
Not more pirates!

976
01:16:10,815 --> 01:16:12,857
Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

977
01:16:13,818 --> 01:16:15,026
Mr Gibbs?

978
01:16:15,736 --> 01:16:17,028
Hey boy, where be Jack?

979
01:16:18,155 --> 01:16:20,657
Jack? Jack Sparrow?

980
01:16:21,909 --> 01:16:23,410
He fell behind.

981
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,502
Keep to the code!

982
01:16:33,754 --> 01:16:36,548
Weigh anchor!
Hoist the sails!

983
01:16:36,632 --> 01:16:38,300
Split-quick, you dibbies!

984
01:16:44,515 --> 01:16:47,559
How the blazes
did you get off that island?

985
01:16:48,978 --> 01:16:52,397
When you marooned me on
that godforsaken spit of land,

986
01:16:52,481 --> 01:16:54,858
you forgot one
very important thing, mate.

987
01:16:56,444 --> 01:16:58,194
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

988
01:16:58,904 --> 01:17:02,532
Well, I won't be making that mistake...

989
01:17:02,575 --> 01:17:03,783

...again.

990
01:17:04,577 --> 01:17:08,038
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

991
01:17:08,122 --> 01:17:09,122
Aye.

992
01:17:10,082 --> 01:17:11,124
Kill him.

993
01:17:12,585 --> 01:17:14,919
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

994
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:18,757
Hold your fire!

995
01:17:25,389 --> 01:17:27,932
You know whose blood we need?

996
01:17:29,644 --> 01:17:31,519
I know whose blood you need.

997
01:17:38,653 --> 01:17:41,237
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

998
01:17:41,322 --> 01:17:42,572
A pirate.

999
01:17:43,741 --> 01:17:45,075
Here.

1000
01:17:45,159 --> 01:17:46,868
Let me.

1001
01:17:46,911 --> 01:17:48,411
Thank you.

1002
01:17:49,789 --> 01:17:52,374
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

1003
01:17:54,251 --> 01:17:55,251
Why?

1004
01:17:58,589 --> 01:17:59,839
I don't know.

1005
01:18:01,842 --> 01:18:04,052
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

1006
01:18:04,095 --> 01:18:08,682
- I know they're rough.
- No... I mean, yes, they are, but...

1007
01:18:11,143 --> 01:18:12,936
But don't stop.

1008
01:18:21,445 --> 01:18:22,862
Elizabeth!

1009
01:18:38,796 --> 01:18:40,130
It's yours.

1010
01:18:44,552 --> 01:18:47,971
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

1011
01:18:48,013 --> 01:18:49,472
It was a gift from my father.

1012
01:18:49,557 --> 01:18:51,641
He sent it to me.

1013
01:18:57,314 --> 01:18:58,857
Why did you take it?

1014
01:19:00,985 --> 01:19:03,737
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

1015
01:19:05,322 --> 01:19:07,115
That would've been awful.

1016
01:19:10,578 --> 01:19:12,370
It wasn't your blood they needed.

1017
01:19:15,166 --> 01:19:17,417
It was my father's blood.

1018
01:19:19,879 --> 01:19:22,464
My blood.

1019
01:19:27,386 --> 01:19:28,762
The blood of a pirate.

1020
01:19:28,846 --> 01:19:30,972
Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

1021
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,947
So you expect to leave me standin' on
some beach, with nothing but a name

1022
01:19:48,032 --> 01:19:53,369
and your word it's the one I need,
and watch you sail away in my ship?

1023
01:19:53,454 --> 01:19:54,621
No.

1024
01:19:54,705 --> 01:19:58,833
I expect to leave you standing on some
beach with absolutely no name at all,

1025
01:19:58,876 --> 01:20:00,960
watching me sail away on my ship,

1026
01:20:01,045 --> 01:20:03,922
and then I'll shout
the name back to you.

1027
01:20:04,006 --> 01:20:05,340
Savvy?

1028
01:20:05,382 --> 01:20:08,426
That still leaves the problem
of me standing on some beach,

1029
01:20:08,511 --> 01:20:12,347
with naught but a name and your word
it's the one I need.

1030
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:14,724
Of the two of us,

1031
01:20:14,809 --> 01:20:18,603
I am the only one who
hasn't committed mutiny.

1032
01:20:18,687 --> 01:20:22,690
Therefore, my word is
the one we'll be trusting.

1033
01:20:22,733 --> 01:20:24,317
Although...

1034
01:20:24,401 --> 01:20:26,986
I suppose I should be thanking you
because, in fact,

1035
01:20:27,071 --> 01:20:29,531
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

1036
01:20:30,574 --> 01:20:34,869
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

1037
01:20:34,912 --> 01:20:36,329
Funny ol' world, isn't it?

1038
01:20:40,251 --> 01:20:42,794
Captain! We're coming up
on the Interceptor.

1039
01:20:55,933 --> 01:20:57,976
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

1040
01:20:58,644 --> 01:21:00,436
What say we run up a flag of truce,

1041
01:21:00,521 --> 01:21:02,313
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

1042
01:21:02,398 --> 01:21:05,859
and I negotiate the return of your
medallion. What say you to that?

1043
01:21:06,819 --> 01:21:10,363
You see, Jack, that's exactly
the attitude that lost you the Pearl.

1044
01:21:10,447 --> 01:21:13,324
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

1045
01:21:14,368 --> 01:21:15,702
Lock him in the brig.

1046
01:21:27,965 --> 01:21:30,425
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!

1047
01:21:30,467 --> 01:21:33,803
With this wind dead astern,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

1048
01:21:33,846 --> 01:21:35,972
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl!

1049
01:21:36,015 --> 01:21:37,515
She's gaining on us!

1050
01:21:42,104 --> 01:21:44,480
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean!

1051
01:21:44,565 --> 01:21:47,317
You can tell them that
after they've caught us!

1052
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:49,277
We're shallower on the draft, right?

1053
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,320
Aye.

1054
01:21:50,404 --> 01:21:52,488
Can't we lose them amongst those shoals?

1055
01:21:53,949 --> 01:21:55,658
We don't have to outrun 'em long.

1056
01:21:55,701 --> 01:21:56,993
Just long enough.

1057
01:21:57,036 --> 01:21:58,328
Lighten the ship!

1058
01:21:58,412 --> 01:21:59,579
Stem to stern!

1059
01:21:59,663 --> 01:22:02,749
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost!

1060
01:22:12,176 --> 01:22:14,177
Apparently, there's a leak.

1061
01:22:28,859 --> 01:22:32,028
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

1062
01:22:32,071 --> 01:22:34,280
And run out the sweeps.

1063
01:23:02,518 --> 01:23:03,768
We're gonna need that.

1064
01:23:12,861 --> 01:23:15,655
It was a good plan, up till now.

1065
01:23:15,739 --> 01:23:17,198
Gibbs!

1066
01:23:17,241 --> 01:23:18,658
We have to make a stand.

1067
01:23:18,742 --> 01:23:20,159
We must fight!

1068
01:23:21,078 --> 01:23:23,204
- Load the guns!
- With what?

1069
01:23:23,247 --> 01:23:24,998
Anything! Everything!

1070
01:23:25,082 --> 01:23:26,791
Anything we have left!

1071
01:23:28,836 --> 01:23:30,795
Load the guns!

1072
01:23:30,879 --> 01:23:32,588
Case shot and langrage!

1073
01:23:32,673 --> 01:23:34,257
Nails and crushed glass!

1074
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:37,969
With a will!

1075
01:23:59,283 --> 01:24:02,118
The Pearl's gonna luff up
on our port quarter!

1076
01:24:02,202 --> 01:24:04,787
She'll rake us without ever
presenting a target!

1077
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:06,914
Lower the anchor on the right side.

1078
01:24:07,499 --> 01:24:08,916
On the starboard side!

1079
01:24:10,002 --> 01:24:13,087
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady!

1080
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:14,130
You both are!

1081
01:24:14,214 --> 01:24:15,631
Daft like Jack!

1082
01:24:16,341 --> 01:24:17,842
Lower the starboard anchor!

1083
01:24:18,469 --> 01:24:22,013
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

1084
01:24:22,097 --> 01:24:23,639
Aye!

1085
01:24:40,491 --> 01:24:41,741
Let go!

1086
01:24:48,332 --> 01:24:49,999
They're club haulin'!

1087
01:24:50,084 --> 01:24:52,835
Hard a port!
Rack the starboard oars!

1088
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,670
Hard a port!

1089
01:25:06,058 --> 01:25:07,308
Keep her steady, man.

1090
01:25:14,358 --> 01:25:15,358
Now!

1091
01:25:15,442 --> 01:25:17,735
Fire!

1092
01:25:27,496 --> 01:25:29,497
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

1093
01:26:16,086 --> 01:26:18,254
We could use a few more ideas, lass!

1094
01:26:18,338 --> 01:26:19,922
It's your turn!

1095
01:26:19,965 --> 01:26:21,757
We need us a devil's dowry!

1096
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,134
We'll give them her!

1097
01:26:24,136 --> 01:26:25,636
She's not what they're after.

1098
01:26:28,223 --> 01:26:29,557
The medallion!

1099
01:26:50,913 --> 01:26:54,248
Strike your colours,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

1100
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:57,043
Hands, grapnels, at the ready!

1101
01:26:57,127 --> 01:26:58,961
Prepare to board!

1102
01:27:33,288 --> 01:27:36,123
Pistols and cutlasses, men!

1103
01:27:36,166 --> 01:27:38,459
Koehler and Twigg
to the powder magazine!

1104
01:27:38,502 --> 01:27:41,837
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

1105
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:53,808
Hey! Hey!

1106
01:28:09,616 --> 01:28:12,285
Hey! Below!

1107
01:28:32,055 --> 01:28:33,556
Thanks very much.

1108
01:28:46,945 --> 01:28:47,945
Jack!

1109
01:28:49,323 --> 01:28:51,115
Bloody empty!

1110
01:29:07,049 --> 01:29:08,924
That's not very nice.

1111
01:29:13,555 --> 01:29:14,764
Where is the medallion?

1112
01:29:14,806 --> 01:29:15,890
Wretch!

1113
01:29:18,935 --> 01:29:20,269
Where is dear William?

1114
01:29:22,481 --> 01:29:23,731
Will!

1115
01:29:25,942 --> 01:29:28,152
- Will!
- Elizabeth!

1116
01:29:31,114 --> 01:29:32,239
Monkey!

1117
01:29:38,914 --> 01:29:40,748
I can't move it!

1118
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:43,125
Will!

1119
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,293
Elizabeth!

1120
01:29:44,336 --> 01:29:45,419
Will!

1121
01:29:56,515 --> 01:29:58,682
Why, thank you, Jack.

1122
01:29:58,767 --> 01:30:00,393
You're welcome.

1123
01:30:00,477 --> 01:30:03,020
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

1124
01:30:04,231 --> 01:30:07,149
Gents! Our hope is restored!

1125
01:30:07,234 --> 01:30:08,651
Yeah!

1126
01:30:43,186 --> 01:30:47,189
Any of you so much
as thinks the word parley,

1127
01:30:47,274 --> 01:30:50,025
I'll have your guts for garters!

1128
01:30:57,909 --> 01:30:59,326
Will!

1129
01:30:59,369 --> 01:31:01,370
Stop it! Stop it!

1130
01:31:02,247 --> 01:31:04,206
Welcome back, miss.

1131
01:31:04,291 --> 01:31:07,042
You took advantage of
our hospitality last time.

1132
01:31:07,085 --> 01:31:10,421
It holds fair now
that you return the favour!

1133
01:31:16,386 --> 01:31:17,470
Barbossa!

1134
01:31:19,431 --> 01:31:20,431
Will.

1135
01:31:23,226 --> 01:31:24,226
She goes free!

1136
01:31:25,353 --> 01:31:27,062
What's in your head, boy?

1137
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:29,732
She goes free.

1138
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,444
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

1139
01:31:33,528 --> 01:31:35,529
Don't do anything stupid!

1140
01:31:38,492 --> 01:31:39,742
You can't.

1141
01:31:39,826 --> 01:31:41,243
I can.

1142
01:31:42,954 --> 01:31:44,580
Like that.

1143
01:31:45,624 --> 01:31:46,916
Who are you?

1144
01:31:46,958 --> 01:31:48,459
No one! He's no one!

1145
01:31:49,211 --> 01:31:52,421
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.

1146
01:31:52,464 --> 01:31:54,757
Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch!

1147
01:31:54,799 --> 01:31:56,467
My name is Will Turner!

1148
01:31:56,551 --> 01:31:59,261
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

1149
01:31:59,304 --> 01:32:01,263
His blood runs in my veins.

1150
01:32:01,973 --> 01:32:04,266
It's the spitting image
of ol' Bootstrap Bill,

1151
01:32:04,351 --> 01:32:06,143
come back to haunt us!

1152
01:32:06,228 --> 01:32:08,229
On my word, do as I say,

1153
01:32:08,271 --> 01:32:10,147
or I'll pull this trigger,

1154
01:32:10,232 --> 01:32:12,441
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!

1155
01:32:13,485 --> 01:32:15,778
Name your terms, Mr Turner.

1156
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:16,987
Elizabeth goes free!

1157
01:32:17,072 --> 01:32:18,697
Yes, we know that one.

1158
01:32:18,782 --> 01:32:19,782
Anything else?

1159
01:32:22,452 --> 01:32:23,744
And the crew!

1160
01:32:23,787 --> 01:32:25,746
The crew are not to be harmed!

1161
01:32:30,502 --> 01:32:32,294
Agreed.

1162
01:32:51,481 --> 01:32:53,148
Barbossa, you lying bastard!

1163
01:32:53,233 --> 01:32:55,818
You swore she'd go free!

1164
01:32:55,902 --> 01:32:58,153
Don't dare impugn me honour, boy!

1165
01:32:58,238 --> 01:32:59,905
I agreed she'd go free.

1166
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:03,033
It was you who failed to specify
when or where.

1167
01:33:08,707 --> 01:33:12,668
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it, lads?

1168
01:33:12,711 --> 01:33:13,711
Aye.

1169
01:33:14,713 --> 01:33:17,881
So I'll be havin' that dress
back before you go.

1170
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:23,721
I always liked you.

1171
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:29,685
Goes with your black heart!

1172
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:32,438
It's still warm.

1173
01:33:35,817 --> 01:33:37,860
Off you go!

1174
01:33:37,944 --> 01:33:39,278
Come on!

1175
01:33:42,907 --> 01:33:44,074
Too long!

1176
01:33:55,211 --> 01:33:57,713
I really rather hoped
we were past all this.

1177
01:33:59,299 --> 01:34:00,716
Jack.

1178
01:34:00,759 --> 01:34:01,842
Jack!

1179
01:34:03,595 --> 01:34:05,054
Did ya not notice?

1180
01:34:05,138 --> 01:34:09,391
That be the same island we made you
governor of on our last little trip.

1181
01:34:10,685 --> 01:34:12,353
I did notice.

1182
01:34:12,395 --> 01:34:16,565
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape,

1183
01:34:16,608 --> 01:34:18,233
but I doubt it.

1184
01:34:21,071 --> 01:34:22,613
Off you go.

1185
01:34:23,615 --> 01:34:26,241
Last time you left me
a pistol with one shot.

1186
01:34:26,326 --> 01:34:27,910
By the powers, you're right!

1187
01:34:27,994 --> 01:34:30,120
Where be Jack's pistol?

1188
01:34:30,205 --> 01:34:31,372
Bring it forward.

1189
01:34:34,542 --> 01:34:37,336
Seeing as there's two of us,
a gentleman...

1190
01:34:38,046 --> 01:34:39,838
...would give us a pair of pistols.

1191
01:34:39,923 --> 01:34:41,632
It'll be one pistol, as before,

1192
01:34:41,716 --> 01:34:44,510
and you can be the gentleman
and shoot the lady,

1193
01:34:44,594 --> 01:34:46,428
and starve to death yourself!

1194
01:35:10,787 --> 01:35:14,331
That's the second time I've had to watch
that man sail away with my ship.

1195
01:35:16,793 --> 01:35:19,461
You were marooned on this island
before, weren't you?

1196
01:35:19,546 --> 01:35:21,130
We can escape the same way!

1197
01:35:21,172 --> 01:35:23,298
To what point and purpose, young missy?

1198
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:25,801
The Black Pearl is gone,

1199
01:35:25,844 --> 01:35:29,304
and unless you have a rudder and
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

1200
01:35:29,389 --> 01:35:31,807
Unlikely...

1201
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:34,810
Young Mr Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

1202
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:39,815
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow!

1203
01:35:39,858 --> 01:35:44,278
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company!

1204
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:47,072
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot!

1205
01:35:47,157 --> 01:35:49,408
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

1206
01:35:51,953 --> 01:35:53,454
How did you escape last time?

1207
01:36:00,295 --> 01:36:02,171
Last time...

1208
01:36:02,213 --> 01:36:05,007
...I was here a grand total
of three days, all right?

1209
01:36:06,009 --> 01:36:07,009
Last time...

1210
01:36:09,053 --> 01:36:12,347
...the rum runners used this island
as a cache.

1211
01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:14,850
They came by and I was able
to barter passage off.

1212
01:36:14,934 --> 01:36:16,685
From the looks of things,

1213
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:18,979
they've long been out of business.

1214
01:36:19,022 --> 01:36:24,151
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

1215
01:36:24,194 --> 01:36:25,736
So that's it then?

1216
01:36:27,030 --> 01:36:30,866
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow!

1217
01:36:31,868 --> 01:36:33,660
You spent three days,

1218
01:36:33,703 --> 01:36:36,038
lying on a beach, drinking rum.

1219
01:36:38,416 --> 01:36:42,211
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

1220
01:36:50,261 --> 01:36:53,514
We're devils, we're black sheep
We're really bad eggs

1221
01:36:53,556 --> 01:36:55,724
Drink up, me hearties
Yo ho

1222
01:36:55,809 --> 01:37:00,354
Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me

1223
01:37:00,396 --> 01:37:02,272
I love this song!

1224
01:37:05,235 --> 01:37:07,402
Really bad eggs!

1225
01:37:12,283 --> 01:37:14,284
When I get the Pearl back,

1226
01:37:14,369 --> 01:37:16,870
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,

1227
01:37:16,913 --> 01:37:18,455
and we'll sing it all the time!

1228
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:22,334
And you will be positively the most
fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main!

1229
01:37:22,418 --> 01:37:24,253
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

1230
01:37:25,296 --> 01:37:27,005
The entire ocean!

1231
01:37:27,090 --> 01:37:28,841
The entire world!

1232
01:37:28,925 --> 01:37:31,760
Wherever we want to go, we go.

1233
01:37:31,803 --> 01:37:33,387
That's what a ship is, you know.

1234
01:37:33,429 --> 01:37:36,265
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

1235
01:37:36,349 --> 01:37:37,850
That's what a ship needs.

1236
01:37:37,934 --> 01:37:39,935
But what a ship is...

1237
01:37:41,312 --> 01:37:44,273
What the Black Pearl really is...

1238
01:37:45,733 --> 01:37:48,986
...is freedom.

1239
01:37:49,988 --> 01:37:51,071
Jack...

1240
01:37:51,114 --> 01:37:55,868
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

1241
01:37:56,661 --> 01:37:57,870
Oh, yes.

1242
01:37:57,954 --> 01:38:00,789
But the company is...

1243
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:03,625
...infinitely better than last time,
and the...

1244
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:09,131
- ...scenery has definitely improved.
- Mr Sparrow!

1245
01:38:09,173 --> 01:38:13,218
I'm not entirely sure I've had
enough rum to allow that kind of talk.

1246
01:38:14,846 --> 01:38:16,638
I know exactly what you mean, love.

1247
01:38:24,147 --> 01:38:25,689
To freedom!

1248
01:38:28,443 --> 01:38:29,985
To the Black Pearl.

1249
01:38:59,515 --> 01:39:00,599
No!

1250
01:39:00,683 --> 01:39:03,477
Not good! Stop!

1251
01:39:03,519 --> 01:39:04,728
Not good!

1252
01:39:04,812 --> 01:39:05,812
What are you doing?

1253
01:39:05,855 --> 01:39:07,940
You've burned all the food, the shade...

1254
01:39:08,024 --> 01:39:10,275
- ...the rum!
- Yes, the rum is gone.

1255
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:11,610
Why is the rum gone?

1256
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:13,946
One, because it is a vile drink

1257
01:39:14,030 --> 01:39:16,949
that turns even the most respectable
men into scoundrels.

1258
01:39:17,033 --> 01:39:20,118
Two, that signal
is over 1,000 feet high.

1259
01:39:20,203 --> 01:39:22,412
The entire Royal Navy
is out looking for me.

1260
01:39:22,497 --> 01:39:24,873
Do you think there is even
the slightest chance

1261
01:39:24,916 --> 01:39:26,083
they won't see it?

1262
01:39:26,167 --> 01:39:28,001
But why is the rum gone?

1263
01:39:29,087 --> 01:39:30,545
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

1264
01:39:30,588 --> 01:39:32,381
You give it one hour, maybe two,

1265
01:39:32,465 --> 01:39:37,386
keep a weather eye open, and you
will see white sails on that horizon.

1266
01:39:42,892 --> 01:39:45,894
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

1267
01:39:45,937 --> 01:39:49,022
"Must've been terrible for you..."
Well, it bloody is now!

1268
01:39:56,406 --> 01:39:59,741
There'll be no
living with her after this.

1269
01:39:59,826 --> 01:40:01,743
- But we've got to save Will!
- No!

1270
01:40:01,786 --> 01:40:03,245
You're safe now.

1271
01:40:03,329 --> 01:40:05,414
We will return to
Port Royal immediately,

1272
01:40:05,498 --> 01:40:07,457
not go gallivanting after pirates!

1273
01:40:07,542 --> 01:40:09,459
Then we condemn him to death!

1274
01:40:10,545 --> 01:40:13,255
The boy's fate is regrettable...

1275
01:40:13,339 --> 01:40:15,924
...but then, so was his decision
to engage in piracy.

1276
01:40:16,009 --> 01:40:19,261
To rescue me! To prevent anything
from happening to me!

1277
01:40:19,345 --> 01:40:23,181
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion,

1278
01:40:23,266 --> 01:40:26,435
the Pearl was listing
near to scuppers after the battle.

1279
01:40:26,477 --> 01:40:29,396
It's very unlikely she'd be able
to make good time.

1280
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:30,772
Think about it.

1281
01:40:30,857 --> 01:40:33,066
The Black Pearl.

1282
01:40:33,109 --> 01:40:36,653
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

1283
01:40:37,655 --> 01:40:39,614
How can you pass that up?

1284
01:40:41,784 --> 01:40:44,619
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr Sparrow,

1285
01:40:44,662 --> 01:40:47,164
- not only myself.
- Commodore, I beg you!

1286
01:40:47,248 --> 01:40:48,248
Please do this!

1287
01:40:48,291 --> 01:40:49,916
For me!

1288
01:40:49,959 --> 01:40:52,127
As a wedding gift.

1289
01:40:52,211 --> 01:40:53,378
Elizabeth?

1290
01:40:54,464 --> 01:40:57,007
Are you accepting
the commodore's proposal?

1291
01:40:59,427 --> 01:41:00,469
I am.

1292
01:41:01,304 --> 01:41:02,971
A wedding! I love weddings!

1293
01:41:03,056 --> 01:41:04,806
Drinks all around!

1294
01:41:07,101 --> 01:41:09,853
I know. "Clap him in irons," right?

1295
01:41:12,398 --> 01:41:13,565
Mr Sparrow...

1296
01:41:14,901 --> 01:41:17,235
...you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

1297
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:19,821
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

1298
01:41:19,864 --> 01:41:23,784
You'll then spend the rest of the voyage
contemplating all possible meanings

1299
01:41:23,826 --> 01:41:26,328
of the phrase "silent as the grave."

1300
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:27,954
Do I make myself clear?

1301
01:41:27,997 --> 01:41:30,082
Inescapably clear.

1302
01:41:34,879 --> 01:41:36,338
Shiver me timbers!

1303
01:41:37,131 --> 01:41:38,757
Cotton says you missed a bit.

1304
01:41:43,763 --> 01:41:45,138
You knew William Turner?

1305
01:41:47,016 --> 01:41:49,101
Old Bootstrap Bill.

1306
01:41:49,185 --> 01:41:50,185
We knew him.

1307
01:41:51,187 --> 01:41:55,190
Never sat well with Bootstrap,
what we did to Jack Sparrow,

1308
01:41:55,233 --> 01:41:57,317
the mutiny and all.

1309
01:41:57,902 --> 01:41:59,903
He said it wasn't right with the code.

1310
01:42:00,988 --> 01:42:04,157
That's why he sent off a piece of
the treasure to you, as it were.

1311
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:07,828
He said we deserved to be cursed...

1312
01:42:09,413 --> 01:42:11,498
...and remain cursed.

1313
01:42:11,541 --> 01:42:12,582
Stupid blighter!

1314
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:14,501
Good man.

1315
01:42:14,544 --> 01:42:16,378
But, as you can imagine,

1316
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:19,798
that didn't sit too well
with the captain.

1317
01:42:19,882 --> 01:42:23,135
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all!

1318
01:42:23,219 --> 01:42:26,847
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!

1319
01:42:29,392 --> 01:42:33,478
So... what the captain did...

1320
01:42:33,563 --> 01:42:36,148
...he strapped a cannon
to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1321
01:42:36,232 --> 01:42:37,732
Bootstrap's bootstraps!

1322
01:42:37,775 --> 01:42:40,777
Last we saw of ol' Bill Turner...

1323
01:42:40,862 --> 01:42:43,321
...he was sinking to
the crushin' black oblivion

1324
01:42:43,406 --> 01:42:46,533
of Davy Jones' locker!

1325
01:42:46,951 --> 01:42:50,036
'Course it was only after that
we learned we needed his blood

1326
01:42:50,079 --> 01:42:51,288
to lift the curse.

1327
01:42:51,372 --> 01:42:54,416
That's what you'd call ironic.

1328
01:42:58,588 --> 01:43:00,213
Bring him!

1329
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:09,431
I don't care for the situation.

1330
01:43:09,974 --> 01:43:13,059
Any attempt to stall in the caves
could turn into an ambush.

1331
01:43:13,102 --> 01:43:16,438
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1332
01:43:16,522 --> 01:43:20,192
I go in and convince Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

1333
01:43:20,276 --> 01:43:23,111
You and your men return to the Dauntless

1334
01:43:23,154 --> 01:43:26,406
and blast the bejesus out of them
with your little cannons.

1335
01:43:26,449 --> 01:43:27,699
What do you have to lose?

1336
01:43:28,784 --> 01:43:31,286
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1337
01:43:32,955 --> 01:43:34,831
Now, to be quite honest with you,

1338
01:43:34,916 --> 01:43:37,876
there's still a slight risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

1339
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:41,755
which includes
the future Mrs Commodore.

1340
01:43:41,797 --> 01:43:44,883
- It's for your safety!
- Don't care what the Commodore ordered!

1341
01:43:44,967 --> 01:43:45,967
I have to tell him!

1342
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:49,012
The pirates! They're cursed!
They can't be killed!

1343
01:43:49,096 --> 01:43:51,640
Don't worry, miss.
He's already informed of that.

1344
01:43:51,682 --> 01:43:55,393
A little mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story!

1345
01:43:55,478 --> 01:43:57,562
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

1346
01:44:09,033 --> 01:44:10,492
No reason to fret.

1347
01:44:10,576 --> 01:44:13,161
Just a prick of the finger,
a few drops of blood...

1348
01:44:13,204 --> 01:44:15,205
No mistakes this time.

1349
01:44:15,289 --> 01:44:16,998
He's only half Turner.

1350
01:44:17,083 --> 01:44:18,500
We spill it all!

1351
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:22,754
Guess there is reason to fret.

1352
01:44:36,686 --> 01:44:38,853
Beg your pardon, mate.
Beg your pardon.

1353
01:44:38,938 --> 01:44:40,689
- Begun by blood...
- Excuse me.

1354
01:44:40,773 --> 01:44:43,483
By blood un...

1355
01:44:45,861 --> 01:44:46,861
Jack!

1356
01:44:47,905 --> 01:44:48,989
It's not possible!

1357
01:44:49,031 --> 01:44:51,199
Not probable.

1358
01:44:51,242 --> 01:44:53,034
Where's Elizabeth?

1359
01:44:54,412 --> 01:44:56,663
She's safe, just like I promised.

1360
01:44:56,706 --> 01:44:59,666
She's all set to marry Norrington,
just like she promised,

1361
01:44:59,709 --> 01:45:02,085
and you get to die for her,
just like you promised.

1362
01:45:02,169 --> 01:45:04,296
So we're all men of our word, really.

1363
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:07,674
Except for Elizabeth,
who is, in fact, a woman.

1364
01:45:07,717 --> 01:45:09,134
Shut up! You're next!

1365
01:45:12,722 --> 01:45:15,557
You don't want to be doing that, mate.

1366
01:45:15,599 --> 01:45:17,559
No, I really think I do.

1367
01:45:19,353 --> 01:45:21,229
Your funeral.

1368
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,401
And why don't I want to be doing it?

1369
01:45:26,444 --> 01:45:28,111
Oh, because...

1370
01:45:29,113 --> 01:45:31,448
Because the HMS Dauntless,

1371
01:45:31,532 --> 01:45:33,950
the pride of the Royal Navy,

1372
01:45:34,035 --> 01:45:37,287
is floating just off shore,

1373
01:45:37,371 --> 01:45:39,080
waiting for you.

1374
01:45:47,256 --> 01:45:48,423
What we doing here?

1375
01:45:50,343 --> 01:45:53,762
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1376
01:45:53,804 --> 01:45:55,889
We catch 'em in a crossfire,

1377
01:45:55,931 --> 01:45:58,767
and send 'em down to see Old Hob.

1378
01:46:00,061 --> 01:46:02,437
I know why we're here. I meant...

1379
01:46:02,521 --> 01:46:04,397
...why aren't we doing what it was...

1380
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:06,274
What Mr Sparrow said we should do?

1381
01:46:06,317 --> 01:46:07,817
With the cannons and all?

1382
01:46:07,902 --> 01:46:10,945
Because it was Mr Sparrow who said it.

1383
01:46:13,574 --> 01:46:16,159
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

1384
01:46:16,243 --> 01:46:18,119
Just hear me out, mate.

1385
01:46:18,204 --> 01:46:21,956
You order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best...

1386
01:46:23,042 --> 01:46:27,462
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt.
There you are with two ships.

1387
01:46:27,546 --> 01:46:29,964
The makings of your very own fleet.

1388
01:46:30,049 --> 01:46:33,635
'Course, you'll take the grandest
as your flagship, and who's to argue?

1389
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:35,136
But what of the Pearl?

1390
01:46:36,764 --> 01:46:38,098
Name me captain.

1391
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:41,601
I'll sail under your colours,
I'll give you ten percent of me plunder,

1392
01:46:41,644 --> 01:46:43,853
and you'll get to
introduce yourself as...

1393
01:46:44,438 --> 01:46:47,315
...Commodore Barbossa.

1394
01:46:47,358 --> 01:46:48,441
Savvy?

1395
01:46:48,484 --> 01:46:50,693
I suppose, in exchange, you'll be

1396
01:46:50,778 --> 01:46:53,613
- wanting me not to kill the whelp.
- No. Not at all!

1397
01:46:53,656 --> 01:46:55,323
By all means, kill the whelp!

1398
01:46:55,366 --> 01:46:57,784
Just not yet.

1399
01:46:57,827 --> 01:46:59,994
Wait to lift the curse

1400
01:47:00,037 --> 01:47:02,705
until the opportune moment.

1401
01:47:06,168 --> 01:47:07,794
For instance...

1402
01:47:09,672 --> 01:47:12,924
...after you've killed Norrington's men.

1403
01:47:13,008 --> 01:47:14,592
Every...

1404
01:47:14,677 --> 01:47:16,344
...last...

1405
01:47:16,387 --> 01:47:17,846
...one.

1406
01:47:27,481 --> 01:47:29,816
You've been planning this
from the beginning!

1407
01:47:29,859 --> 01:47:31,443
Ever since you learned my name!

1408
01:47:32,278 --> 01:47:33,278
Yeah.

1409
01:47:35,614 --> 01:47:37,740
I want 50 percent of your plunder.

1410
01:47:37,825 --> 01:47:38,825
- 15!
- 40!

1411
01:47:38,868 --> 01:47:39,868
25!

1412
01:47:41,036 --> 01:47:42,370
And I'll buy you the hat.

1413
01:47:42,413 --> 01:47:44,414
A really big one.

1414
01:47:45,207 --> 01:47:46,374
Commodore.

1415
01:47:49,503 --> 01:47:50,712
We have an accord.

1416
01:47:52,381 --> 01:47:54,674
All hands to the boats!

1417
01:47:55,676 --> 01:47:56,801
Apologies.

1418
01:47:56,886 --> 01:47:58,553
You give the orders.

1419
01:47:59,889 --> 01:48:00,889
Gents...

1420
01:48:01,891 --> 01:48:03,266
...take a walk!

1421
01:48:08,105 --> 01:48:09,439
Not to the boats?

1422
01:49:08,832 --> 01:49:11,751
Hold fire!

1423
01:49:13,796 --> 01:49:16,589
This is just like what
the Greeks done at Troy!

1424
01:49:17,967 --> 01:49:19,592
'Cept they was in a horse,

1425
01:49:19,635 --> 01:49:21,094
instead of dresses.

1426
01:49:21,804 --> 01:49:23,179
Wooden horse.

1427
01:49:36,151 --> 01:49:37,151
A moment, please.

1428
01:49:41,323 --> 01:49:42,323
Elizabeth?

1429
01:49:45,578 --> 01:49:47,370
I just want you to know, I...

1430
01:49:48,497 --> 01:49:50,957
I believe you made a very
good decision today.

1431
01:49:51,792 --> 01:49:53,793
Couldn't be more proud of you!

1432
01:49:54,295 --> 01:49:55,420
But, you know,

1433
01:49:55,504 --> 01:49:58,423
even a good decision,
if made for the wrong reasons,

1434
01:49:58,507 --> 01:50:00,008
can be a wrong decision.

1435
01:50:09,018 --> 01:50:10,018
Lieutenant.

1436
01:50:29,204 --> 01:50:30,371
Elizabeth?

1437
01:50:32,541 --> 01:50:33,791
Are you there?

1438
01:50:36,045 --> 01:50:38,671
Elizabeth, are you even listening to me?

1439
01:51:05,783 --> 01:51:07,867
What have you done?

1440
01:51:08,827 --> 01:51:11,496
Stop that!
I already feel like a fool!

1441
01:51:12,539 --> 01:51:13,915
Look nice, though.

1442
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:20,838
Do I look nice now?!

1443
01:51:56,792 --> 01:51:58,042
I must admit, Jack.

1444
01:51:58,127 --> 01:52:00,044
I thought I had you figured.

1445
01:52:00,129 --> 01:52:03,297
But it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1446
01:52:03,382 --> 01:52:05,341
Me, I'm dishonest.

1447
01:52:05,426 --> 01:52:08,261
And a dishonest man you can
always trust to be dishonest.

1448
01:52:08,303 --> 01:52:09,554
Honestly...

1449
01:52:09,638 --> 01:52:12,265
...it's the honest ones
you want to watch out for.

1450
01:52:12,307 --> 01:52:14,600
'Cause you can never predict

1451
01:52:14,643 --> 01:52:17,937
when they're going to do
something incredibly...

1452
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:18,980
...stupid.

1453
01:52:52,306 --> 01:52:54,348
You're off the edge of the map, mate.

1454
01:52:54,433 --> 01:52:56,476
Here, there be monsters!

1455
01:53:01,356 --> 01:53:02,690
Right.

1456
01:53:04,359 --> 01:53:06,444
What would you pick to eat first?

1457
01:53:06,528 --> 01:53:08,446
I think we should decide now,

1458
01:53:08,530 --> 01:53:10,698
just so we're ready when the time comes!

1459
01:53:35,766 --> 01:53:36,891
What was that?

1460
01:53:59,832 --> 01:54:00,832
It's Elizabeth!

1461
01:54:21,436 --> 01:54:23,104
Make for the ship! Move!

1462
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:18,451
You can't beat me, Jack.

1463
01:55:42,851 --> 01:55:44,268
That's interesting!

1464
01:55:55,155 --> 01:55:57,073
I couldn't resist, mate.

1465
01:57:03,432 --> 01:57:04,640
Sorry!

1466
01:57:13,734 --> 01:57:15,401
So, what now, Jack Sparrow?

1467
01:57:15,444 --> 01:57:18,195
Are we to be two immortals,
locked in an empty battle

1468
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:20,990
until Judgment Day,
when the trumpets sound?

1469
01:57:21,658 --> 01:57:23,075
Or you could surrender.

1470
01:57:50,395 --> 01:57:51,604
All of you with me!

1471
01:57:51,646 --> 01:57:53,731
Will is in that cave,
and we must save him!

1472
01:57:53,815 --> 01:57:56,400
Ready, and... heave!

1473
01:58:02,991 --> 01:58:05,034
Please, I need your help! Come on!

1474
01:58:05,994 --> 01:58:07,828
Any port in a storm.

1475
01:58:07,913 --> 01:58:09,997
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl!

1476
01:58:10,082 --> 01:58:12,333
What about Jack?
Are you just gonna leave him?

1477
01:58:12,417 --> 01:58:14,210
Jack owes us a ship!

1478
01:58:14,294 --> 01:58:15,836
There's the code to consider.

1479
01:58:16,421 --> 01:58:17,546
The code?

1480
01:58:19,299 --> 01:58:21,759
You're pirates!
Hang the code

1481
01:58:21,843 --> 01:58:23,511
and hang the rules!

1482
01:58:23,553 --> 01:58:25,971
They're more like guidelines, anyway.

1483
01:58:29,768 --> 01:58:31,936
Bloody pirates!

1484
01:58:43,365 --> 01:58:45,533
Is it supposed to be doing that?

1485
01:58:45,617 --> 01:58:47,827
They're stealing our ship!

1486
01:58:48,286 --> 01:58:49,954
Bloody pirates!

1487
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:53,874
Boarders away!

1488
01:59:02,092 --> 01:59:04,093
Come on!

1489
01:59:29,995 --> 01:59:31,328
Me eye!

1490
01:59:51,266 --> 01:59:53,350
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain!

1491
01:59:53,435 --> 01:59:55,019
You like pain?

1492
01:59:56,813 --> 01:59:58,189
Try wearing a corset.

1493
02:00:08,575 --> 02:00:10,201
Whose side is Jack on?

1494
02:00:10,285 --> 02:00:13,329
You mean at the moment?

1495
02:00:48,281 --> 02:00:49,406
No fair!

1496
02:01:13,431 --> 02:01:15,266
Ten years you carry that pistol,

1497
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:17,685
and now you waste your shot!

1498
02:01:18,687 --> 02:01:21,647
He didn't waste it.

1499
02:01:46,298 --> 02:01:47,798
I feel...

1500
02:01:52,387 --> 02:01:53,679
...cold.

1501
02:02:55,950 --> 02:02:58,410
Parley?

1502
02:02:58,453 --> 02:03:00,329
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

1503
02:03:00,413 --> 02:03:02,873
Huzzah! Huzzah!

1504
02:03:11,591 --> 02:03:12,591
Huzzah!

1505
02:03:48,670 --> 02:03:51,004
We should return to the Dauntless.

1506
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:57,177
Your fiancé will be wanting
to know you're safe.

1507
02:04:06,855 --> 02:04:10,149
If you were waiting for
the opportune moment...

1508
02:04:11,151 --> 02:04:12,484
...that was it.

1509
02:04:13,945 --> 02:04:16,113
Now if you'd be so kind,
I'd be much obliged

1510
02:04:16,197 --> 02:04:19,032
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

1511
02:04:23,621 --> 02:04:25,789
I'm sorry, Jack.

1512
02:04:27,709 --> 02:04:29,918
They done what's right by them.

1513
02:04:30,003 --> 02:04:31,753
Can't expect more than that.

1514
02:04:47,353 --> 02:04:48,687
Jack Sparrow!

1515
02:04:48,730 --> 02:04:52,816
- We have learned that you...
- Captain! Captain Jack Sparrow.

1516
02:04:53,526 --> 02:04:56,778
...for your wilful commission
of crimes against the crown.

1517
02:04:56,863 --> 02:05:00,574
Said crimes being numerous in quantity,

1518
02:05:00,658 --> 02:05:02,201
and sinister in nature.

1519
02:05:02,869 --> 02:05:04,369
The most egregious of these

1520
02:05:04,412 --> 02:05:06,622
to be cited herewith:

1521
02:05:06,706 --> 02:05:10,459
- Piracy, smuggling...
- This is wrong.

1522
02:05:11,461 --> 02:05:14,463
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law,

1523
02:05:14,547 --> 02:05:17,090
as are we all.

1524
02:05:17,133 --> 02:05:19,843
...impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

1525
02:05:19,928 --> 02:05:23,013
impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England...

1526
02:05:23,097 --> 02:05:24,223
Oh, yes!

1527
02:05:24,265 --> 02:05:26,266
Sailing under false colours,

1528
02:05:26,351 --> 02:05:30,562
arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching,

1529
02:05:30,605 --> 02:05:36,568
brigandage, pilfering,
depravity, depredation,

1530
02:05:36,611 --> 02:05:38,445
and general lawlessness.

1531
02:05:39,822 --> 02:05:41,490
And for these crimes,

1532
02:05:41,574 --> 02:05:44,117
you have been sentenced to be,
on this day,

1533
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:47,913
hung by the neck, until dead.

1534
02:05:47,956 --> 02:05:50,249
May God have mercy on your soul.

1535
02:05:50,291 --> 02:05:51,833
Governor Swann.

1536
02:05:51,918 --> 02:05:53,835
Commodore.

1537
02:05:55,338 --> 02:05:56,338
Elizabeth.

1538
02:05:57,799 --> 02:06:00,634
I should've told you every day,
from the moment I met you.

1539
02:06:02,470 --> 02:06:04,972
I love you.

1540
02:06:19,529 --> 02:06:21,280
Boy, watch yourself!

1541
02:06:21,322 --> 02:06:22,447
Marines!

1542
02:06:22,490 --> 02:06:24,032
I can't breathe!

1543
02:06:25,952 --> 02:06:26,952
Elizabeth!

1544
02:06:29,956 --> 02:06:30,998
Move!

1545
02:06:41,884 --> 02:06:44,094
You men! With me!

1546
02:07:18,087 --> 02:07:19,087
Come on, men!

1547
02:07:44,697 --> 02:07:48,700
I thought we might have to endure some
manner of ill-conceived escape attempt.

1548
02:07:49,535 --> 02:07:51,119
But not from you.

1549
02:07:51,204 --> 02:07:52,579
On our return to Port Royal,

1550
02:07:52,664 --> 02:07:55,040
I granted you clemency.

1551
02:07:55,083 --> 02:07:56,750
And this is how you thank me?

1552
02:07:56,793 --> 02:07:58,877
By throwing in your lot with him?

1553
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:00,504
He's a pirate!

1554
02:08:00,588 --> 02:08:02,547
And a good man.

1555
02:08:03,341 --> 02:08:05,592
If all I've achieved here
is that the hangman

1556
02:08:05,635 --> 02:08:07,761
will own two pairs
of boots instead of one,

1557
02:08:07,845 --> 02:08:09,471
so be it.

1558
02:08:09,555 --> 02:08:11,431
At least my conscience will be clear.

1559
02:08:11,474 --> 02:08:14,434
You forget your place, Turner.

1560
02:08:15,978 --> 02:08:17,604
It's right here,

1561
02:08:17,647 --> 02:08:19,106
between you and Jack.

1562
02:08:23,111 --> 02:08:24,778
As is mine.

1563
02:08:24,862 --> 02:08:26,238
Elizabeth!

1564
02:08:27,699 --> 02:08:28,865
Lower your weapons.

1565
02:08:29,659 --> 02:08:31,660
For goodness sake, put them down!

1566
02:08:36,749 --> 02:08:39,668
So this is where
your heart truly lies, then.

1567
02:08:41,295 --> 02:08:42,796
It is.

1568
02:08:51,305 --> 02:08:55,183
Well! I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

1569
02:08:55,268 --> 02:08:57,769
I think we've all arrived
at a very special place.

1570
02:08:57,812 --> 02:08:58,895
Spiritually.

1571
02:08:58,980 --> 02:09:00,981
Ecumenically.

1572
02:09:01,065 --> 02:09:02,274
Grammatically.

1573
02:09:03,735 --> 02:09:06,319
I want you to know that
I was rooting for you, mate.

1574
02:09:07,613 --> 02:09:08,613
Know that.

1575
02:09:12,618 --> 02:09:14,119
Elizabeth.

1576
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:18,665
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1577
02:09:20,126 --> 02:09:22,002
I'm sorry.

1578
02:09:24,130 --> 02:09:25,130
Will!

1579
02:09:27,425 --> 02:09:29,092
Nice hat.

1580
02:09:31,053 --> 02:09:32,637
Friends!

1581
02:09:34,557 --> 02:09:37,350
This the day that you will always

1582
02:09:37,393 --> 02:09:40,020
remember as the day that...

1583
02:09:44,984 --> 02:09:47,652
Idiot! He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose!

1584
02:09:50,072 --> 02:09:51,907
Sail ho!

1585
02:09:59,457 --> 02:10:02,083
What's your plan of action?

1586
02:10:02,835 --> 02:10:03,835
Sir?

1587
02:10:08,216 --> 02:10:10,675
Perhaps on the rare occasion

1588
02:10:10,718 --> 02:10:14,596
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

1589
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:18,475
piracy itself can be the right course?

1590
02:10:22,730 --> 02:10:24,022
Mr Turner!

1591
02:10:30,112 --> 02:10:32,948
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1592
02:10:38,913 --> 02:10:40,539
This is a beautiful sword.

1593
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,751
I would expect the man who made it

1594
02:10:44,794 --> 02:10:49,589
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

1595
02:10:51,634 --> 02:10:53,385
Thank you.

1596
02:10:56,264 --> 02:10:57,305
Commodore!

1597
02:10:57,390 --> 02:10:59,099
What about Sparrow?

1598
02:11:01,018 --> 02:11:03,937
Oh, I think we can afford
to give him one day's head start.

1599
02:11:13,197 --> 02:11:16,283
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

1600
02:11:17,660 --> 02:11:19,953
After all...

1601
02:11:19,996 --> 02:11:21,538
...he is a blacksmith.

1602
02:11:22,540 --> 02:11:23,790
No.

1603
02:11:28,504 --> 02:11:30,797
He's a pirate.

1604
02:11:54,989 --> 02:11:56,656
Bring him in!

1605
02:12:07,043 --> 02:12:09,628
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the code.

1606
02:12:09,670 --> 02:12:12,339
We figured they were more actual...

1607
02:12:12,423 --> 02:12:14,382
...guidelines.

1608
02:12:18,512 --> 02:12:20,221
Thank you.

1609
02:12:21,349 --> 02:12:22,724
Captain Sparrow.

1610
02:12:27,021 --> 02:12:28,605
The Black Pearl is yours!

1611
02:12:44,413 --> 02:12:46,081
On deck, you scabrous dogs!

1612
02:12:46,165 --> 02:12:47,624
Hands to braces!

1613
02:12:47,708 --> 02:12:49,960
Let go and haul to run free.

1614
02:12:51,629 --> 02:12:53,421
Now...

1615
02:12:53,506 --> 02:12:55,340
Bring me that horizon.

1616
02:13:02,640 --> 02:13:04,724
And really bad eggs

1617
02:13:08,062 --> 02:13:10,563
Drink up, me hearties
