1
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,627
Yo ho
Yo ho

2
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,756
A pirate's life for me

3
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:53,594
We extort, we pilfer
We filch, we sack

4
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,138
- Drink...
- Quiet, missy!

5
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,599
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

6
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,934
You don't want to bring
them down on us, do ya?

7
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,811
Mr Gibbs, that will do.

8
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,481
She was singing about pirates!

9
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,649
Bad luck to be singing about pirates

10
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,903
with us mired in this unnatural fog,
mark my words.

11
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,321
Consider them marked.

12
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,492
- On your way.
- Aye, Lieutenant.

13
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,660
Bad luck to have a woman on board, too.

14
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,954
Even a miniature one.

15
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,541
I think it'd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

16
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,337
Think again, Miss Swann.

17
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,256
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of 'em.

18
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,468
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

19
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,137
or wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves.

20
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,516
A short drop and a sudden stop.

21
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,189
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervour,

22
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,860
but I'm concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter.

23
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,737
My apologies, Governor Swann.

24
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,031
Actually, I find it all fascinating.

25
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,866
Yes. That's what concerns me.

26
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,146
Look! A boy!

27
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,564
There's a boy in the water!

28
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,359
Man overboard!

29
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,946
Man the ropes!
Fetch a hook!

30
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,115
Haul him aboard!

31
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,584
He's still breathing.

32
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,919
Mary, Mother of God!

33
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,927
What happened here?

34
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,141
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

35
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,811
Lot of good it did them.

36
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,439
Everyone's thinking it,
I'm just saying it.

37
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,524
Pirates!

38
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,444
There's no proof of that!

39
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,029
It was probably an accident.

40
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,407
Rouse the captain immediately.

41
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,367
- Aye, sir.
- Heave to and take in sail.

42
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,119
- Lower the boats.
- Heave to!

43
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,624
Elizabeth, I want you
to accompany the boy.

44
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,126
He'll be in your charge.

45
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,836
Take care of him.

46
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,815
It's OK.

47
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,652
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

48
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,404
Will Turner.

49
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,324
I'm watching over you, Will.

50
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,838
You're a pirate!

51
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,091
Has he said anything?

52
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,759
His name's William Turner.

53
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,344
That's all I found out.

54
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,388
Take him below.

55
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,084
Elizabeth!

56
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,755
Are you all right?

57
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,299
Are you decent?

58
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:43,925
Yes.

59
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:44,968
Yes?

60
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,929
Still in bed at this hour?

61
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,433
It's a beautiful day.

62
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,354
I have a gift for you.

63
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,276
- Oh, it's beautiful!
- Isn't it?

64
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,905
May I inquire as to the occasion?

65
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,033
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

66
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:10,994
Go on.

67
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,957
Actually, I...

68
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,253
I had hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

69
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,588
Ceremony?

70
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,049
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.

71
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,300
I knew it!

72
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,678
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

73
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,680
A fine gentleman, don't you think?

74
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,974
He fancies you, you know.

75
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,060
Elizabeth?

76
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,812
How's it coming?

77
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,647
It's difficult to say.

78
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,817
I'm told it's the
latest fashion in London.

79
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,235
Well, women in London

80
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,986
must've learned not to breathe!

81
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,824
My Lord, you have a visitor.

82
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,343
Mr Turner.

83
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,845
Good to see you again.

84
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,054
Good day, sir.

85
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,849
I have your order.

86
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,522
Well...

87
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,357
The blade is folded steel.

88
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,444
That's gold filigree
laid into the handle.

89
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,404
If I may?

90
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,032
Perfectly balanced.

91
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,119
The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade.

92
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,207
Impressive. Very impressive.

93
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,584
Very nice.

94
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,254
Commodore Norrington's going
to be very pleased with this.

95
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,883
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

96
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,052
I shall.

97
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,849
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

98
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,854
Elizabeth! You look absolutely stunning.

99
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,897
Will.

100
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,733
It's so good to see you.

101
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,694
I had a dream about you last night.

102
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,820
About me?

103
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,489
Is it entirely proper for you...

104
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,407
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

105
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,243
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

106
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,829
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

107
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,165
At least once more, Miss Swann.

108
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,083
As always.

109
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,418
Now, you see?

110
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,754
At least the boy
has a sense of propriety.

111
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,088
We really must be going.

112
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,131
Come on.

113
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,759
Good day, Mr Turner.

114
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,345
Come along!

115
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,933
Good day...

116
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,270
...Elizabeth.

117
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,654
Hold up there, you!

118
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,659
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.

119
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,371
And I shall need to know your name.

120
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,335
What do you say to three shillings,

121
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,628
and we forget the name?

122
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,300
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr Smith.

123
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,588
Two paces... march!

124
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,134
Right about... face!

125
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,431
Present... arms!

126
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,458
This dock is off limits to civilians.

127
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,293
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.

128
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,046
If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

129
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,262
Apparently, there's some high-toned
and fancy to-do up at the fort, eh?

130
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,473
How could it be two upstanding
gentlemen, such as yourselves,

131
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,517
did not merit an invitation?

132
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,770
Someone has to make sure this dock
stays off limit to civilians.

133
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,189
It's a fine goal, to be sure.

134
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,233
But it seems to me, a...

135
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,068
...a ship like that...

136
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,155
makes this one here
a bit superfluous, really.

137
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,324
Oh, the Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true enough,

138
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:27,328
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

139
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,455
I've heard of one.

140
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,166
It's supposed to be very fast,
nigh uncatchable.

141
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,001
The Black Pearl.

142
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,046
There's no real ship

143
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,798
that can match the Interceptor.

144
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,510
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

145
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,179
No, it's not.

146
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,555
Yes, it is. I've seen it!

147
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,390
You've seen it?

148
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,516
Yes.

149
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,518
You haven't seen it!

150
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,644
Yes, I have!

151
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,146
You've seen a ship

152
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,190
with black sails,

153
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,941
that's crewed by the damned,

154
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,527
and captained by a man so evil

155
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,197
that hell itself spat him back out?

156
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,241
No.

157
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,411
But I have seen a ship with black sails.

158
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,372
And no ship that's
not crewed by the damned,

159
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,334
and captained by a man so evil
that hell spat him back out

160
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,044
could possibly have black sails,

161
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,213
therefore couldn't possibly
be any other ship

162
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,716
than the Black Pearl,
is that what you're saying?

163
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,884
No.

164
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,219
Like I said,

165
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,514
there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor...

166
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,975
Hey!

167
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,436
You!

168
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,605
Get away from there!

169
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,066
You don't have permission
to be aboard there!

170
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,818
Sorry. It's such a pretty boat.

171
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,902
Ship!

172
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,654
What's your name?

173
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,738
Smith!

174
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,532
Or Smithy, if you like.

175
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,868
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
Mr Smith?

176
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,911
Yeah, and no lies!

177
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,454
All right then.

178
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,539
I confess.

179
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,251
It is my intention to commandeer
one of these ships, pick up a crew

180
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,754
in Tortuga to rape, pillage, and pilfer
my weasely black guts out.

181
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,714
I said, no lies!

182
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,675
I think he's telling the truth.

183
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,301
If he were telling the truth,

184
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,636
he wouldn't have told us.

185
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:11,140
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe
the truth, even if he told it to you.

186
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,236
May I have a moment?

187
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,955
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

188
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,790
Yes.

189
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,544
I apologise if I seem forward,

190
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,713
but I must speak my mind.

191
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,594
This promotion throws into sharp relief

192
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,597
that which I have not yet achieved.

193
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,809
A marriage to a fine woman.

194
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,022
You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.

195
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,982
I can't breathe.

196
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,859
Yes, I...

197
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,444
I'm a bit nervous myself.

198
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,032
And then they made me their chief.

199
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,036
Elizabeth?

200
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,748
Elizabeth!

201
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,711
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

202
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,507
- Will you be saving her, then?
- I can't swim!

203
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,678
Pearl of the King's Navy, you are!

204
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,430
Do not lose these!

205
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,112
What was that?

206
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,948
I got her!

207
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,492
She's not breathing!

208
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,576
Move!

209
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,419
I never would've thought of that.

210
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,754
Clearly you've never been to Singapore.

211
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,970
Where did you get that?

212
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,598
On your feet.

213
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,019
Elizabeth!

214
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,355
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

215
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,904
- Shoot him!
- Father! Commodore...

216
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,990
...do you intend to kill my rescuer?

217
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,166
I believe thanks are in order.

218
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,631
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, did we?

219
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,966
Pirate?

220
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,510
Hang him.

221
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,346
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

222
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,932
Well, well.

223
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,477
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

224
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,188
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

225
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,148
Well, I don't see your ship...

226
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,399
...captain.

227
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,818
I'm in the market, as it were.

228
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,862
He said he'd come to commandeer one.

229
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,740
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his, sir.

230
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,330
No additional shots nor powder.

231
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,000
A compass that doesn't point north.

232
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,674
And I half expected it
to be made from wood.

233
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,097
You are, without doubt,
the worst pirate I've heard of.

234
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,516
But you have heard of me.

235
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,479
Commodore, I really must protest!

236
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,689
Carefully, lieutenant.

237
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,025
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!

238
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,654
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness!

239
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,447
But it seems enough to condemn him.

240
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,865
Indeed.

241
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,785
Finally.

242
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,538
Wait, don't shoot!

243
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,914
I knew you'd warm up to me.

244
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,792
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please.

245
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,544
And my hat.

246
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,504
Commodore.

247
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,426
- Elizabeth. It is Elizabeth, isn't it?
- It's Miss Swann.

248
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,054
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.

249
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,723
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

250
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,476
Now, if you'll be very kind.

251
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,911
Easy on the goods, darling.

252
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,789
You're despicable.

253
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,875
Sticks and stones, love.

254
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,501
I saved your life, you save mine.

255
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,586
We're square.

256
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,796
Gentlemen...

257
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,339
...my lady...

258
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,759
...you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

259
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,262
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

260
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,324
Now, will you shoot him?

261
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,075
Open fire!

262
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,792
Burn his heels!

263
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,227
Take cover, men!

264
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,229
Gillette...

265
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,148
...Mr Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows.

266
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,525
I would hate for him to miss it.

267
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,948
Search upstairs!

268
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,492
Look lively, men!

269
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,879
Right where I left you.

270
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,262
Not where I left you.

271
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,691
You're the one they're hunting.

272
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,860
The pirate!

273
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,739
You seem somewhat familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

274
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,533
I make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

275
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,287
It would be a shame to put
a black mark on your record.

276
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,872
So if you'll excuse me...

277
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,544
Do you think this wise, boy?

278
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,673
Crossing blades with a pirate?

279
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,133
You threatened Miss Swann.

280
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,513
Only a little.

281
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,279
You know what you're doing,
I'll give you that. Excellent form.

282
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,865
But how's your footwork?

283
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,034
If I step here...

284
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,829
Very good.

285
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,956
And now I step again.

286
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,003
Ta.

287
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,567
That is a wonderful trick.

288
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,530
Except, once again,
you are between me and my way out.

289
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,739
And now...

290
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,783
...you have no weapon.

291
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,765
Who makes all these?

292
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,560
I do.

293
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,896
And I practice with them...

294
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,564
...three hours a day.

295
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,568
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

296
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,203
Or... perhaps the reason
you practice three hours a day

297
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,079
is that you already found one,

298
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,750
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

299
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,294
You're not a eunuch, are you?

300
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,297
I practice three hours a day
so that when I meet a pirate,

301
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,757
I can kill him!

302
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,127
You cheated.

303
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,461
Pirate.

304
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,009
- Move away!
- No.

305
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,427
Please move?

306
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,511
No!

307
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,347
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

308
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,893
This shot is not meant for you.

309
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,239
There he is! Over here!

310
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,201
Excellent work, Mr Brown.

311
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:05,080
You've assisted in the capture
of a dangerous fugitive.

312
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,458
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

313
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,045
I trust you will always remember
that this is the day

314
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,548
Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

315
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,342
Take him away.

316
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,557
- Come here, boy!
- Smell it?

317
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,685
- Come here, boy!
- You want a nice, juicy bone?

318
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,146
- Hey!
- Come here, boy!

319
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,732
- Come here, boy!
- You can keep doing that forever.

320
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,026
The dog is never going to move.

321
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:38,364
Well, excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet!

322
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,824
Come on!

323
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,372
There you go, miss.

324
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,208
It was a difficult day for you,
I'm sure.

325
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,919
I suspected Commodore Norrington
would propose,

326
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,588
but I must admit,
I wasn't entirely prepared for it.

327
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,924
I meant you being
threatened by that pirate!

328
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,217
Sounds terrifying!

329
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,720
Oh... Yes, it was terrifying.

330
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,764
But... the Commodore proposed!

331
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,432
Fancy that.

332
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,101
Now that's a smart match, miss,

333
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,311
if it's not too bold to say.

334
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,771
It is a smart match.

335
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,732
He's a fine man.

336
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,528
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

337
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,739
Well, that Will Turner,

338
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,950
he's a fine man, too.

339
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,785
That is too bold.

340
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,954
Well, beggin' your pardon, miss.

341
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,664
It was not my place.

342
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,716
Has my daughter given
you an answer yet?

343
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,509
No, she hasn't.

344
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,887
Well, she has had a very trying day.

345
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,724
Ghastly weather, don't you think?

346
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,684
Bleak. Really bleak.

347
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,479
What's that?

348
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,440
Cannon fire!

349
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,693
Return fire!

350
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,487
I know those guns!

351
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,745
It's the Pearl!

352
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,538
Black Pearl?

353
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,667
I've heard stories.

354
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,713
She's been preying on ships and
settlements for near ten years.

355
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,381
Never leaves any survivors.

356
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,883
No survivors.

357
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,761
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

358
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,814
Clear the dock!

359
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,254
On your oars!

360
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,063
Sight the muzzle flash.

361
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,148
Aim for the flashes.

362
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,317
I need a full spread, fore and aft.

363
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,027
Mr Stevens, more cartridges!

364
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,031
Governor!
Barricade yourself in my office.

365
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,991
Good God!

366
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,659
That's an order.

367
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,887
Don't!

368
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,847
Hello, chum.

369
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,645
Up there! Go!

370
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,115
Miss! They've come to kidnap you!

371
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,785
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!

372
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,036
In here!

373
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:41,959
They haven't seen you. Hide, and the
first chance you get, run to the fort!

374
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,095
Got ya! Haven't I?

375
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,143
No! No! It's hot!

376
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,062
- I'm burning!
- Come on!

377
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,859
Come on, me lads!

378
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,430
Come out!

379
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,859
We know you're here, poppet.

380
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,111
Poppet.

381
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,237
Come out...

382
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,365
...and we promise we won't hurt you.

383
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,700
Eh?

384
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,454
We will find you, poppet.

385
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,915
You've got something of ours,

386
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,751
and it calls to us.

387
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,967
The gold calls to us.

388
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,178
The gold.

389
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,352
Hello, poppet.

390
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,896
Parley!

391
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,814
What?

392
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,024
Parley.

393
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,525
I invoke the right of parley.

394
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,529
According to the code of brethren, set
down by pirates Morgan and Bartholomew,

395
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,699
- you have to take me to your captain.
- I know the code.

396
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,494
If an adversary demands parley,
you can do them no harm

397
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,330
- until the parley is complete.
- To blazes with the code!

398
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,373
She wants to be taken to the captain.

399
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,169
And she'll go, without a fuss.

400
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,256
We must honour the code.

401
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,268
Say goodbye!

402
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,233
Goodbye.

403
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,155
- Come on!
- Elizabeth!

404
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,783
Well!

405
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,166
Out of my way, scum!

406
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,682
My sympathies, friend.
You've no manner of luck at all.

407
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,581
Come on, doggy!

408
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,499
It's just you and me now.

409
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,960
It's you and old Jack.
Come on.

410
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,753
Come on. That's a boy!

411
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,964
Good boy. Come get your bone!

412
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,842
That's a good boy.
Come on, a bit closer, a bit closer.

413
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,053
That's it! That's it, doggy!

414
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:26,099
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy cur!

415
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,435
Don't do that. No, no, no!

416
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,145
I didn't mean it! I didn't...

417
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,570
This ain't the armoury!

418
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,489
Well, well, well.

419
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,451
Look what we have here, Twigg.

420
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,620
Captain Jack Sparrow.

421
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,956
Last time I saw you,

422
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,791
you were all alone

423
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,628
on a godforsaken island,

424
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,880
shrinking into the distance.

425
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,466
His fortunes aren't improved much.

426
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,969
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

427
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:06,056
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers

428
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,682
and mutineers.

429
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,313
So there is a curse.

430
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,399
That's interesting.

431
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,735
You know nothing of hell.

432
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,412
That's very interesting.

433
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,409
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.

434
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,537
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

435
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:14,457
- I am here to negotia...
- You will speak when spoken to!

436
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,544
And ye will not lay a hand on those

437
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,005
under the protection of parley.

438
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,798
Aye, sir.

439
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,428
My apologies, miss.

440
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,847
Captain Barbossa,

441
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:33,310
I am here to negotiate the cessation
of hostilities against Port Royal.

442
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:38,440
A lot of long words in there, miss.
We are not but humble pirates.

443
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,109
What is it that you want?

444
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,320
I want you to leave and never come back.

445
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,575
I'm disinclined
to acquiesce to your request.

446
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,495
Means "no."

447
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:54,914
Very well.

448
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,586
I'll drop it.

449
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:07,802
Me holds are burstin' with swag!
That bit of shine matters to us?

450
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,304
Why?

451
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,724
It's what you've been searching for.

452
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,434
I recognise the ship.

453
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,395
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!

454
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,605
Did you now?

455
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,609
Fine.

456
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,195
I suppose if it is worthless,

457
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,322
then there's no point in me keeping it.

458
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,448
No!

459
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,461
You have a name, missy?

460
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,630
Elizabeth...

461
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,048
...Turner.

462
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,259
I'm a maid in the governor's household.

463
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,972
Miss Turner!

464
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,433
Turner!

465
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,893
Bootstrap!

466
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,608
And how does a maid come
to own a trinket such as that?

467
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,277
Family heirloom, perhaps?

468
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,822
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

469
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,493
Very well. You hand it over,
we'll put your town to our rudder,

470
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,786
and ne'er return.

471
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,509
Our bargain?

472
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,347
Still the guns and stow 'em.

473
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,225
Signal the men, set the flags
and make good to clear port.

474
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,018
Wait! You have to take me to shore.

475
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,688
According to the code of
the order of the brethren...

476
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,442
Your return to shore was not part of
our negotiation nor our agreements,

477
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,693
so I must do nothin'.

478
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,863
Secondly, you must be a pirate
for the pirate's code to apply,

479
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,531
and you're not, and thirdly...

480
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,325
...the code is more of what
you'd call a guideline,

481
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,869
instead of actual rules.

482
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,329
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,

483
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,873
Miss Turner.

484
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,979
They've taken her!
They've taken Elizabeth!

485
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,148
Mr Murtogg, remove this man.

486
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,318
We have to hunt them down!
We must save her!

487
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,445
And where do you propose we start?

488
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:35,366
If you have any information concerning
my daughter, please share it.

489
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,412
That Jack Sparrow!

490
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,748
He talked about the Black Pearl.

491
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,708
Mentioned it is more what he did.

492
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,421
Ask him where it is! Make a deal
with him, he could lead us to it.

493
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,964
No.

494
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,343
The pirates who invaded this fort
left Sparrow locked in his cell,

495
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:56,429
ergo they are not his allies.

496
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,474
Governor, we will establish
their most likely course...

497
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,434
That's not good enough!

498
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,436
Mr Turner...

499
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:07,023
...you are not a military man,
you are not a sailor.

500
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,442
You are a blacksmith.

501
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,320
And this is not the moment
for rash actions!

502
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,617
Do not make the mistake of thinking
you are the only man here

503
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,202
who cares for Elizabeth.

504
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,417
Please...

505
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,549
You! Sparrow!

506
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,633
Aye?

507
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,302
You are familiar with that ship,
the Black Pearl?

508
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,720
I've heard of it.

509
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,473
Where does it make berth?

510
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,434
Have you not heard the stories?

511
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,105
Captain Barbossa

512
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,898
and his crew of miscreants

513
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,568
sail from the dreaded Isla de Muerte.

514
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,445
It's an island that
cannot be found, except

515
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,574
by those who already know where it is.

516
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,325
The ship's real enough,

517
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,829
therefore its anchorage must be
a real place. Where is it?

518
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,998
Why ask me?

519
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,250
Because you're a pirate.

520
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,003
And you want to turn pirate yourself.
Is that it?

521
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,255
Never!

522
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,677
They took Miss Swann.

523
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,554
So it is that you found a girl!

524
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,431
I see.

525
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,267
If you're intending to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

526
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,311
and so, win fair lady's heart...

527
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,980
...you'll have to do it alone, mate.

528
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,107
I see no profit in it for me.

529
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,443
I can get you out of here.

530
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,194
How's that? The key's run off.

531
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,863
I helped build these cells.

532
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,699
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

533
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,287
With the right leverage,
and the proper application of strength,

534
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,831
the door will lift free.

535
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,460
What's your name?

536
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,462
Will Turner.

537
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,090
That would be short for William,
I imagine.

538
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,342
Good, strong name.

539
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,261
No doubt named for your father?

540
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,014
Yes.

541
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,185
Well, Mr Turner,

542
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,436
I've changed me mind.

543
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:12,106
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear, on pain of death,

544
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,400
I shall take you to the Black Pearl,

545
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,110
and your bonny lass.

546
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,196
Do we have an accord?

547
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,534
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

548
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,744
Get me out.

549
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:32,043
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

550
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,134
We're going to steal the ship?

551
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:42,929
That ship?

552
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,847
Commandeer.

553
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,183
We're going to commandeer that ship.

554
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,351
Nautical term.

555
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,104
One question about your business, boy,

556
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,605
or there's no use going.

557
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,190
This girl...

558
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,984
...how far are you willing to go
to save her?

559
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,403
I'd die for her.

560
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,654
Oh, good.

561
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,739
No worries then.

562
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:23,302
This is either madness or brilliance.

563
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:27,724
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

564
00:45:57,379 --> 00:46:01,174
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.

565
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,967
Aye! Avast!

566
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,514
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.

567
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,184
You'll never make it out of the bay.

568
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,852
Son...

569
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,731
...I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

570
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,357
Savvy?

571
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:22,904
Commodore!

572
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,198
Sir! They're taking the Dauntless!

573
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,284
Commodore!

574
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,703
They're taking the ship!

575
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,081
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!

576
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,500
Rash, Turner.

577
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,210
Too rash.

578
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,965
He is, without doubt,
the worst pirate I have ever seen.

579
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,553
Here they come.

580
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,644
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

581
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:04,362
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

582
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:23,256
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!
Now!

583
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:33,182
Thank you, Commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

584
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,852
We'd have had a hard time
of it by ourselves.

585
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,148
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

586
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,776
With the wind a quarter astern,
we won't catch them!

587
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,779
I don't need to. Just get them
in range of the long nines.

588
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,948
Hands, come about! Run out the guns!

589
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,366
Bring out the guns!

590
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,035
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

591
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,956
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

592
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,458
Commodore!

593
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,586
He's disabled the rudder chain, sir.

594
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,966
Abandon ship!

595
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,100
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

596
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,937
So it would seem.

597
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,448
When I was a lad, living in England,

598
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,450
my mother raised me by herself.

599
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,493
After she died, I came out here,

600
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,412
looking for my father.

601
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:38,998
Is that so?

602
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,751
My father,

603
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,210
Bill Turner?

604
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,881
At the jail, it was only after you
learned my name that you agreed to help.

605
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,675
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

606
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,302
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

607
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,346
You knew my father.

608
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,561
I knew him.

609
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,564
Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

610
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:07,068
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap," or "Bootstrap Bill."

611
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,152
Bootstrap?

612
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,572
Good man.
Good pirate.

613
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,741
I swear, you look just like him.

614
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:14,867
It's not true.

615
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,702
He was a merchant sailor.

616
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,038
A good, respectable man
who obeyed the law.

617
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,290
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

618
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,378
My father was not a pirate!

619
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,547
Put it away, son.

620
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,549
It's not worth you getting beat again.

621
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,759
You didn't beat me.

622
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:35,179
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

623
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,057
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

624
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,651
Now as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

625
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:51,237
The only rules
that really matter are these:

626
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:55,199
What a man can do,
and what a man can't do.

627
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,076
For instance,

628
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,287
you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man,

629
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,414
or you can't.

630
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:05,001
Pirate is in your blood, boy, so
you'll have to square with that someday.

631
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,045
Now, me, for example.
I could let you drown,

632
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:12,591
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies. Savvy?

633
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:13,926
So...

634
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:22,309
Can you sail under
the command of a pirate?

635
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,895
Or can you not?

636
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:28,649
Tortuga?

637
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,484
Tortuga.

638
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:56,886
More importantly, it is indeed
a sad life that has never breathed deep

639
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,139
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

640
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,017
What do you think?

641
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,397
It'll linger.

642
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:12,485
I'll tell you, mate, if every town
in the world were like this one,

643
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,029
no man would ever feel unwanted.

644
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,074
Scarlett!

645
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,327
Not sure I deserved that.

646
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,288
Giselle!

647
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,331
Who was she?

648
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,415
What?

649
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,002
I may have deserved that.

650
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:35,382
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

651
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,845
Mother's love!

652
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:40,930
Jack!

653
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,059
You should know better than to
wake a man when he's sleepin'.

654
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:49,021
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

655
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,399
The man who did the waking buys
the man who was sleeping a drink,

656
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,903
and the man who was sleeping drinks
while listening to a proposition

657
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,696
from the man who did the waking.

658
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,700
Aye, that'll about do it.

659
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,791
Blast! I'm already awake!

660
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,251
That was for the smell.

661
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,221
Keep a sharp eye.

662
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,437
Now...

663
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,982
...what's the nature
of this venture of you'rn?

664
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,902
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

665
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,241
I know where it's going to be,

666
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,076
and I'm gonna take it.

667
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,120
Jack,

668
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,497
it's a fool's errand!

669
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,917
Well, you know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl!

670
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,086
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

671
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,422
All I need is a crew.

672
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,133
What I hear tell of Captain Barbossa,

673
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:02,219
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one!

674
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,513
I'd say it's a good thing
I'm not a fool, then.

675
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:05,681
Prove me wrong!

676
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,685
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

677
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:13,105
Let's just say
it's a matter of leverage, eh?

678
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,331
The kid?

679
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,919
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

680
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,464
His only child. Savvy?

681
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,466
Is he now?

682
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,804
Leverage, says you.

683
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,849
I think I feel
a change in the wind, says I.

684
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,309
I'll find us a crew.

685
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,312
There's bound to be some sailors
on this rock, crazy as you.

686
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,689
One can only hope.

687
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,525
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

688
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,177
You'll be dining with the captain,

689
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,596
and he requests you wear this.

690
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:32,184
Tell the captain I'm "disinclined
to acquiesce to his request."

691
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,562
He said you'd say that.

692
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,023
He also said, if that be the case...

693
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,858
...you'll be dining with the crew,

694
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,443
and you'll be naked.

695
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,285
Fine.

696
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:09,513
There's no need to stand on ceremony
no call to impress anyone.

697
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,932
You must be hungry.

698
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,576
Try the wine.

699
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,417
And the apples. One of those next.

700
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,385
It's poisoned.

701
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,264
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

702
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:55,768
Then release me. You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.

703
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,815
You don't know what this is,

704
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,275
do you?

705
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,611
It's a pirate medallion.

706
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,738
This is Aztec gold.

707
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,408
One of 882 identical pieces

708
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:15,037
they delivered in a stone chest
to Cortés himself.

709
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:20,334
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

710
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:24,254
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

711
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,800
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

712
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,303
...a terrible curse.

713
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:37,184
Any mortal that removes but
a single piece from that stone chest...

714
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,646
...shall be punished for eternity.

715
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:46,360
I hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

716
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,653
Aye.

717
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,990
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

718
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,952
Buried on an Isle of the Dead
what cannot be found,

719
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,870
except for those who know where it is.

720
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,915
Find it, we did.

721
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,918
There be the chest.

722
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,795
Inside be the gold.

723
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,173
And we took 'em all!

724
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,217
We spent 'em and traded 'em,

725
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,969
and frittered 'em away

726
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,763
on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

727
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,849
The more we gave 'em away,

728
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,560
the more we came to realise...

729
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,021
...the drink would not satisfy.

730
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,025
Food turned to ash in our mouths...

731
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,279
...and all the pleasurable company
in the world

732
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:32,364
could not slake our lust.

733
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:37,035
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

734
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,457
Compelled by greed we were, but now...

735
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,877
...we are consumed by it.

736
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,974
There is one way we can end our curse.

737
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:06,023
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold

738
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,483
must be restored,

739
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,985
and the blood repaid.

740
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,114
Thanks to ye,

741
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,325
we have the final piece.

742
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,662
And the... blood to be repaid?

743
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,248
That's why there's no sense
to be killing ya.

744
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,042
Yet.

745
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,587
Apple?

746
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,138
Let me go!

747
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:46,438
I'm curious.

748
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,441
After killing me, what is it
you're planning on doing next?

749
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,215
Look!

750
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,218
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

751
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:02,264
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

752
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,016
But neither are we dead.

753
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:09,062
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

754
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:11,523
Too long I've been starvin' to death,

755
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,233
and haven't died!

756
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,652
I feel nothing.

757
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,364
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

758
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,951
...nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

759
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:28,457
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

760
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,541
You're in one!

761
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,562
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

762
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,448
Feast your eyes, captain.

763
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:04,451
All of them,
faithful hands before the mast.

764
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:07,746
Every man worth his salt...

765
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,831
...and crazy to boot.

766
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,751
So this is your able-bodied crew?

767
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,591
You, sailor!

768
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,051
Cotton, sir.

769
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,886
Mr Cotton.

770
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:26,264
Do you have the courage and fortitude
to follow orders and stay true

771
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,933
in the face of danger and death?

772
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,685
Mr Cotton!

773
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:30,894
Answer, man!

774
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,354
He's a mute, sir.

775
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,147
Poor devil had his tongue cut out.

776
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,274
So he trained the parrot
to talk for him.

777
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,235
No one's yet figured how.

778
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,073
Mr Cotton's parrot.

779
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,575
Same question.

780
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:48,370
When do you sail?
When do you sail?

781
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,581
Mostly, we figure that means "yes."

782
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,125
Of course it does.

783
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,209
Satisfied?

784
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:57,254
Well, you've proved they're mad!

785
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,131
And what's the benefit for us?

786
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:10,726
Anamaria!

787
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,980
I suppose you didn't deserve
that one, either.

788
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,982
No, that one I deserved.

789
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,775
You stole my boat!

790
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:19,901
Actually...

791
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,364
Borrowed. Borrowed, without permission,

792
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:27,033
but with every intention
of bringing it back to you.

793
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,535
But you didn't!

794
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:29,995
You'll get another one!

795
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,372
I will!

796
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:33,457
A better one.

797
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:34,958
A better one!

798
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,502
- That one!
- What one?

799
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,381
That one?

800
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,553
Aye. That one.

801
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,221
- What say you?
- Aye!

802
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,681
Aye!

803
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,766
Anchors away!

804
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:54,060
No, no, no, no, no!
It's frightful bad luck

805
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,645
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

806
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:58,356
It'll be far worse not to have her.

807
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,101
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find,

808
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,646
with a compass that doesn't work?

809
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,689
Aye, the compass doesn't point north,

810
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:42,567
but we're not trying
to find north, are we?

811
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,622
We should drop canvas, sir.

812
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,749
She can hold a bit longer.

813
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:03,505
What's in your head that's put you
in such a fine mood, captain?

814
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:05,590
We're catching up.

815
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,607
Time to go, poppet.

816
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:22,584
Dead men tell no tales...

817
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:27,797
Puts a chill in the bones,
how many honest sailors

818
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,674
have been claimed by this passage.

819
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:47,525
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

820
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:50,779
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
'fore he showed up in Tortuga

821
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:53,531
with a mind to go after
the treasure of Isla de Muerte.

822
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:54,866
That was before I met him,

823
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,118
back when he was captain
of the Black Pearl.

824
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:58,995
What?

825
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,125
He failed to mention that.

826
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,461
He plays things closer to the vest now.

827
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:08,630
And a hard-learned lesson it was.

828
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,591
Three days before the venture,
the first mate comes says,

829
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:14,761
"Everything's an equal share.
That should mean the location

830
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:18,223
of the treasure, too,"
so Jack gives up the bearings.

831
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,558
That night, there was a mutiny.

832
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:24,270
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

833
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:27,023
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

834
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:33,530
So that's the reason for all the...

835
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,283
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

836
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,412
Now, Will, when a pirate's marooned,

837
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:43,248
he's given a pistol with a single shot.
One shot...

838
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:46,626
Well, that won't do much good hunting,
nor to be rescued.

839
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,921
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

840
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:53,341
that pistol starts to look
real friendly.

841
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,427
But Jack, he escaped the island,

842
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,095
and still has that single shot.

843
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,764
He won't use it, though,
save on one man.

844
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:02,809
His mutinous first mate.

845
01:07:02,893 --> 01:07:04,853
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

846
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:09,065
- How did Jack get off the island?
- Well, I'll tell ye.

847
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:11,234
He waded out into the shallows,

848
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,862
and he waited there three days
and three nights,

849
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:17,782
till all manner of sea creatures
came acclimated to his presence.

850
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,326
And on the fourth morning,

851
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:24,539
he roped a couple of sea turtles,
lashed them together and made a raft.

852
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:29,210
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.

853
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,587
Sea turtles!

854
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,841
What did he use for rope?

855
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:41,389
Human hair.

856
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:43,808
From my back.

857
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:46,352
Let go the anchor!

858
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,813
Lower the anchor line!

859
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,316
Young Mr Turner and I are to go ashore.

860
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,068
Captain.

861
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,861
What if the worst should happen?

862
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,239
- Keep to the code.
- Aye. The code.

863
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:27,310
Ten years of hoarding swag!

864
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,854
And now we finally get to spend it!

865
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:39,989
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men...

866
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:44,410
...and you can buy an eye what
actually fits and is made of glass.

867
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:47,413
This one does splinter
something terrible!

868
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:49,707
Stop rubbing it!

869
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:12,397
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

870
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:14,732
The pirates' code.

871
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,234
Any man who falls behind...

872
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,611
...is left behind.

873
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:22,240
No heroes amongst thieves.

874
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:26,035
You know, for having
such a bleak outlook on pirates,

875
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:28,997
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

876
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,082
Sprung a man from jail...

877
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,919
...commandeered a ship of the fleet,

878
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:37,505
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga...

879
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:42,927
...and you're completely
obsessed with treasure!

880
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:46,806
That's not true.

881
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,267
I am not obsessed with treasure.

882
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:59,235
Not all treasure
is silver and gold, mate.

883
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:00,945
Gentlemen, the time has come!

884
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,614
Hurrah!

885
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,824
Salvation is nigh!

886
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,326
Yeah!

887
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,120
- Our torment is nearing an end!
- Elizabeth.

888
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,582
For ten years,
we've been tested and tried,

889
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,375
and each man-jack of you here

890
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,462
has proved his mettle 100 times over.

891
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:19,797
And 100 times again!

892
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:20,840
Yeah!

893
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:23,551
Suffered, I have!

894
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,137
Punished, we were,

895
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,722
the lot of us,

896
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:31,142
disproportionate to our crime!

897
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,019
Right!

898
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:34,312
Here it is!

899
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:41,611
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

900
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:46,157
Every last piece that went astray,

901
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,951
we have returned.

902
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:49,702
Save for this!

903
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,204
- Yeah!
- Jack!

904
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,915
Not yet!

905
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:56,501
We'll wait for the opportune moment.

906
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:59,337
...despairing
of ever finding the lass.

907
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,214
When's that?

908
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:04,008
When it's of greatest profit to you?

909
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:05,385
May I ask you something?

910
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:09,097
Have I ever given you
reason not to trust me?

911
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:11,474
Do us a favour.

912
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,643
I know it's difficult for you,

913
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:15,728
but please, stay here,

914
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:18,690
and try not to do anything stupid.

915
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,861
And who among us
has paid the blood sacrifice

916
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,197
- owed to the heathen gods?
- Aye!

917
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,117
And whose blood must yet be paid?

918
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:30,868
Hers!

919
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:37,625
You know the first thing I'm going
to do after the curse is lifted?

920
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:43,298
Eat a whole bushel of apples!

921
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,141
Begun by blood,

922
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:55,226
by blood undone.

923
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:00,732
Sorry, Jack.

924
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,359
I'm not going to be your leverage.

925
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,746
That's it?

926
01:12:14,788 --> 01:12:16,456
Waste not.

927
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:55,787
Did it work?

928
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:58,706
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

929
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,298
You're not dead!

930
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:09,967
No.

931
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,261
He shot me!

932
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,805
It didn't work!

933
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,848
The curse is still upon us!

934
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:23,398
You! Maid! Your father,
what was his name?

935
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,733
Was your father William Turner?

936
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,318
No.

937
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:30,863
Where's his child? The child that sailed
from England eight years ago?

938
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:33,658
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

939
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,700
Where?

940
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:43,000
You two!

941
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:46,087
- You brought us the wrong person!
- Yeah!

942
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:48,047
No!

943
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,592
She had the medallion!
She's the proper age!

944
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:53,845
She said her name was Turner.
You heard her!

945
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,181
I think she lied to us!

946
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,224
Yeah!

947
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:02,353
You brought us here for nothing!

948
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:06,524
I won't take questionin' or
second-guessin' from you, Mr Twigg!

949
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:07,859
Who's to blame him?

950
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:10,862
Every decision you've made
has led us from bad to worse!

951
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:15,658
It was you who sent
Bootstrap to the depths!

952
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:16,701
Yeah!

953
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:22,081
And it's you who brought us
here in the first place!

954
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:26,544
If any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

955
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:30,756
I say, we cut her throat,

956
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:32,467
and spill all her blood!

957
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:33,551
Just in case.

958
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:34,594
Yeah!

959
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:44,896
The medallion!

960
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:46,272
She's taken it!

961
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:50,818
Get after her,
you feckless pack of ingrates!

962
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:59,368
- Where's the oars?
- There's no oars!

963
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:02,246
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!

964
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,340
You!

965
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:16,093
You're supposed to be dead!

966
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:17,470
Am I not?

967
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:39,659
...parsnip... pars-ley...

968
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:41,744
...Partner, pardoner...

969
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:42,787
Parley?

970
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:44,705
That's the one! Parley!

971
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:46,457
Parley!

972
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,792
Parley?!

973
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:52,838
Damned to the depths whatever
madman thought of parley!

974
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:56,759
That would be the French.

975
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,772
Not more pirates!

976
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,857
Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

977
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,026
Mr Gibbs?

978
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:16,028
Hey boy, where be Jack?

979
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:19,657
Jack? Jack Sparrow?

980
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,410
He fell behind.

981
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,502
Keep to the code!

982
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:35,548
Weigh anchor!
Hoist the sails!

983
01:16:35,632 --> 01:16:37,300
Split-quick, you dibbies!

984
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:46,559
How the blazes
did you get off that island?

985
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:51,397
When you marooned me on
that godforsaken spit of land,

986
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:53,858
you forgot one
very important thing, mate.

987
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,194
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

988
01:16:57,904 --> 01:17:01,532
Well, I won't be making that mistake...

989
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:02,783

...again.

990
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:07,038
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

991
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,122
Aye.

992
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:10,124
Kill him.

993
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:13,919
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

994
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:17,757
Hold your fire!

995
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:26,932
You know whose blood we need?

996
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,519
I know whose blood you need.

997
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,237
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

998
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,572
A pirate.

999
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:44,075
Here.

1000
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,868
Let me.

1001
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:47,411
Thank you.

1002
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:51,374
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

1003
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:54,251
Why?

1004
01:17:57,589 --> 01:17:58,839
I don't know.

1005
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:03,052
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

1006
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:07,682
- I know they're rough.
- No... I mean, yes, they are, but...

1007
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:11,936
But don't stop.

1008
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:21,862
Elizabeth!

1009
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:39,130
It's yours.

1010
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:46,971
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

1011
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:48,472
It was a gift from my father.

1012
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:50,641
He sent it to me.

1013
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:57,857
Why did you take it?

1014
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:02,737
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

1015
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:06,115
That would've been awful.

1016
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,370
It wasn't your blood they needed.

1017
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,417
It was my father's blood.

1018
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:21,464
My blood.

1019
01:19:26,386 --> 01:19:27,762
The blood of a pirate.

1020
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,972
Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

1021
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,947
So you expect to leave me standin' on
some beach, with nothing but a name

1022
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:52,369
and your word it's the one I need,
and watch you sail away in my ship?

1023
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:53,621
No.

1024
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:57,833
I expect to leave you standing on some
beach with absolutely no name at all,

1025
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,960
watching me sail away on my ship,

1026
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:02,922
and then I'll shout
the name back to you.

1027
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:04,340
Savvy?

1028
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:07,426
That still leaves the problem
of me standing on some beach,

1029
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:11,347
with naught but a name and your word
it's the one I need.

1030
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:13,724
Of the two of us,

1031
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:17,603
I am the only one who
hasn't committed mutiny.

1032
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:21,690
Therefore, my word is
the one we'll be trusting.

1033
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:23,317
Although...

1034
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:25,986
I suppose I should be thanking you
because, in fact,

1035
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:28,531
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

1036
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:33,869
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

1037
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,329
Funny ol' world, isn't it?

1038
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:41,794
Captain! We're coming up
on the Interceptor.

1039
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,976
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

1040
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,436
What say we run up a flag of truce,

1041
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,313
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

1042
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:04,859
and I negotiate the return of your
medallion. What say you to that?

1043
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:09,363
You see, Jack, that's exactly
the attitude that lost you the Pearl.

1044
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:12,324
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

1045
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,702
Lock him in the brig.

1046
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:29,425
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!

1047
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:32,803
With this wind dead astern,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

1048
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:34,972
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl!

1049
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:36,515
She's gaining on us!

1050
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:43,480
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean!

1051
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,317
You can tell them that
after they've caught us!

1052
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:48,277
We're shallower on the draft, right?

1053
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,320
Aye.

1054
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:51,488
Can't we lose them amongst those shoals?

1055
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:54,658
We don't have to outrun 'em long.

1056
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:55,993
Just long enough.

1057
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:57,328
Lighten the ship!

1058
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:58,579
Stem to stern!

1059
01:21:58,663 --> 01:22:01,749
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost!

1060
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,177
Apparently, there's a leak.

1061
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:31,028
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

1062
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:33,280
And run out the sweeps.

1063
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:02,768
We're gonna need that.

1064
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:14,655
It was a good plan, up till now.

1065
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:16,198
Gibbs!

1066
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,658
We have to make a stand.

1067
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:19,159
We must fight!

1068
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:22,204
- Load the guns!
- With what?

1069
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:23,998
Anything! Everything!

1070
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,791
Anything we have left!

1071
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,795
Load the guns!

1072
01:23:29,879 --> 01:23:31,588
Case shot and langrage!

1073
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,257
Nails and crushed glass!

1074
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:36,969
With a will!

1075
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:01,118
The Pearl's gonna luff up
on our port quarter!

1076
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:03,787
She'll rake us without ever
presenting a target!

1077
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,914
Lower the anchor on the right side.

1078
01:24:06,499 --> 01:24:07,916
On the starboard side!

1079
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:12,087
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady!

1080
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,130
You both are!

1081
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:14,631
Daft like Jack!

1082
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:16,842
Lower the starboard anchor!

1083
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:21,013
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

1084
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:22,639
Aye!

1085
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:40,741
Let go!

1086
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:48,999
They're club haulin'!

1087
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,835
Hard a port!
Rack the starboard oars!

1088
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,670
Hard a port!

1089
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:06,308
Keep her steady, man.

1090
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:14,358
Now!

1091
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,735
Fire!

1092
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:28,497
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

1093
01:26:15,086 --> 01:26:17,254
We could use a few more ideas, lass!

1094
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:18,922
It's your turn!

1095
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:20,757
We need us a devil's dowry!

1096
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,134
We'll give them her!

1097
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:24,636
She's not what they're after.

1098
01:26:27,223 --> 01:26:28,557
The medallion!

1099
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:53,248
Strike your colours,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

1100
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:56,043
Hands, grapnels, at the ready!

1101
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:57,961
Prepare to board!

1102
01:27:32,288 --> 01:27:35,123
Pistols and cutlasses, men!

1103
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:37,459
Koehler and Twigg
to the powder magazine!

1104
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:40,837
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

1105
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:52,808
Hey! Hey!

1106
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:11,285
Hey! Below!

1107
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:32,556
Thanks very much.

1108
01:28:45,945 --> 01:28:46,945
Jack!

1109
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:50,115
Bloody empty!

1110
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:07,924
That's not very nice.

1111
01:29:12,555 --> 01:29:13,764
Where is the medallion?

1112
01:29:13,806 --> 01:29:14,890
Wretch!

1113
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:19,269
Where is dear William?

1114
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:22,731
Will!

1115
01:29:24,942 --> 01:29:27,152
- Will!
- Elizabeth!

1116
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:31,239
Monkey!

1117
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,748
I can't move it!

1118
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:42,125
Will!

1119
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:43,293
Elizabeth!

1120
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:44,419
Will!

1121
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:57,682
Why, thank you, Jack.

1122
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:59,393
You're welcome.

1123
01:29:59,477 --> 01:30:02,020
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

1124
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:06,149
Gents! Our hope is restored!

1125
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,651
Yeah!

1126
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:46,189
Any of you so much
as thinks the word parley,

1127
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:49,025
I'll have your guts for garters!

1128
01:30:56,909 --> 01:30:58,326
Will!

1129
01:30:58,369 --> 01:31:00,370
Stop it! Stop it!

1130
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:03,206
Welcome back, miss.

1131
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:06,042
You took advantage of
our hospitality last time.

1132
01:31:06,085 --> 01:31:09,421
It holds fair now
that you return the favour!

1133
01:31:15,386 --> 01:31:16,470
Barbossa!

1134
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:19,431
Will.

1135
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:23,226
She goes free!

1136
01:31:24,353 --> 01:31:26,062
What's in your head, boy?

1137
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,732
She goes free.

1138
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,444
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

1139
01:31:32,528 --> 01:31:34,529
Don't do anything stupid!

1140
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:38,742
You can't.

1141
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,243
I can.

1142
01:31:41,954 --> 01:31:43,580
Like that.

1143
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:45,916
Who are you?

1144
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:47,459
No one! He's no one!

1145
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:51,421
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.

1146
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:53,757
Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch!

1147
01:31:53,799 --> 01:31:55,467
My name is Will Turner!

1148
01:31:55,551 --> 01:31:58,261
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

1149
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:00,263
His blood runs in my veins.

1150
01:32:00,973 --> 01:32:03,266
It's the spitting image
of ol' Bootstrap Bill,

1151
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,143
come back to haunt us!

1152
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:07,229
On my word, do as I say,

1153
01:32:07,271 --> 01:32:09,147
or I'll pull this trigger,

1154
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:11,441
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!

1155
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:14,778
Name your terms, Mr Turner.

1156
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:15,987
Elizabeth goes free!

1157
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:17,697
Yes, we know that one.

1158
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:18,782
Anything else?

1159
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:22,744
And the crew!

1160
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:24,746
The crew are not to be harmed!

1161
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:31,294
Agreed.

1162
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:52,148
Barbossa, you lying bastard!

1163
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,818
You swore she'd go free!

1164
01:32:54,902 --> 01:32:57,153
Don't dare impugn me honour, boy!

1165
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:58,905
I agreed she'd go free.

1166
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:02,033
It was you who failed to specify
when or where.

1167
01:33:07,707 --> 01:33:11,668
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it, lads?

1168
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:12,711
Aye.

1169
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:16,881
So I'll be havin' that dress
back before you go.

1170
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,721
I always liked you.

1171
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:28,685
Goes with your black heart!

1172
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,438
It's still warm.

1173
01:33:34,817 --> 01:33:36,860
Off you go!

1174
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:38,278
Come on!

1175
01:33:41,907 --> 01:33:43,074
Too long!

1176
01:33:54,211 --> 01:33:56,713
I really rather hoped
we were past all this.

1177
01:33:58,299 --> 01:33:59,716
Jack.

1178
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:00,842
Jack!

1179
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,054
Did ya not notice?

1180
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:08,391
That be the same island we made you
governor of on our last little trip.

1181
01:34:09,685 --> 01:34:11,353
I did notice.

1182
01:34:11,395 --> 01:34:15,565
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape,

1183
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:17,233
but I doubt it.

1184
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:21,613
Off you go.

1185
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:25,241
Last time you left me
a pistol with one shot.

1186
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:26,910
By the powers, you're right!

1187
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:29,120
Where be Jack's pistol?

1188
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:30,372
Bring it forward.

1189
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:36,336
Seeing as there's two of us,
a gentleman...

1190
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:38,838
...would give us a pair of pistols.

1191
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:40,632
It'll be one pistol, as before,

1192
01:34:40,716 --> 01:34:43,510
and you can be the gentleman
and shoot the lady,

1193
01:34:43,594 --> 01:34:45,428
and starve to death yourself!

1194
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:13,331
That's the second time I've had to watch
that man sail away with my ship.

1195
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:18,461
You were marooned on this island
before, weren't you?

1196
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,130
We can escape the same way!

1197
01:35:20,172 --> 01:35:22,298
To what point and purpose, young missy?

1198
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,801
The Black Pearl is gone,

1199
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:28,304
and unless you have a rudder and
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

1200
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,807
Unlikely...

1201
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:33,810
Young Mr Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

1202
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,815
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow!

1203
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:43,278
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company!

1204
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:46,072
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot!

1205
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:48,408
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

1206
01:35:50,953 --> 01:35:52,454
How did you escape last time?

1207
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:01,171
Last time...

1208
01:36:01,213 --> 01:36:04,007
...I was here a grand total
of three days, all right?

1209
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,009
Last time...

1210
01:36:08,053 --> 01:36:11,347
...the rum runners used this island
as a cache.

1211
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:13,850
They came by and I was able
to barter passage off.

1212
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:15,685
From the looks of things,

1213
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,979
they've long been out of business.

1214
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:23,151
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

1215
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:24,736
So that's it then?

1216
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:29,866
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow!

1217
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:32,660
You spent three days,

1218
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:35,038
lying on a beach, drinking rum.

1219
01:36:37,416 --> 01:36:41,211
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

1220
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:52,514
We're devils, we're black sheep
We're really bad eggs

1221
01:36:52,556 --> 01:36:54,724
Drink up, me hearties
Yo ho

1222
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:59,354
Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me

1223
01:36:59,396 --> 01:37:01,272
I love this song!

1224
01:37:04,235 --> 01:37:06,402
Really bad eggs!

1225
01:37:11,283 --> 01:37:13,284
When I get the Pearl back,

1226
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:15,870
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,

1227
01:37:15,913 --> 01:37:17,455
and we'll sing it all the time!

1228
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:21,334
And you will be positively the most
fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main!

1229
01:37:21,418 --> 01:37:23,253
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

1230
01:37:24,296 --> 01:37:26,005
The entire ocean!

1231
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,841
The entire world!

1232
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:30,760
Wherever we want to go, we go.

1233
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:32,387
That's what a ship is, you know.

1234
01:37:32,429 --> 01:37:35,265
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

1235
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:36,850
That's what a ship needs.

1236
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:38,935
But what a ship is...

1237
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:43,273
What the Black Pearl really is...

1238
01:37:44,733 --> 01:37:47,986
...is freedom.

1239
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:50,071
Jack...

1240
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:54,868
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

1241
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:56,870
Oh, yes.

1242
01:37:56,954 --> 01:37:59,789
But the company is...

1243
01:37:59,832 --> 01:38:02,625
...infinitely better than last time,
and the...

1244
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:08,131
- ...scenery has definitely improved.
- Mr Sparrow!

1245
01:38:08,173 --> 01:38:12,218
I'm not entirely sure I've had
enough rum to allow that kind of talk.

1246
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:15,638
I know exactly what you mean, love.

1247
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:24,689
To freedom!

1248
01:38:27,443 --> 01:38:28,985
To the Black Pearl.

1249
01:38:58,515 --> 01:38:59,599
No!

1250
01:38:59,683 --> 01:39:02,477
Not good! Stop!

1251
01:39:02,519 --> 01:39:03,728
Not good!

1252
01:39:03,812 --> 01:39:04,812
What are you doing?

1253
01:39:04,855 --> 01:39:06,940
You've burned all the food, the shade...

1254
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:09,275
- ...the rum!
- Yes, the rum is gone.

1255
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,610
Why is the rum gone?

1256
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:12,946
One, because it is a vile drink

1257
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:15,949
that turns even the most respectable
men into scoundrels.

1258
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:19,118
Two, that signal
is over 1,000 feet high.

1259
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:21,412
The entire Royal Navy
is out looking for me.

1260
01:39:21,497 --> 01:39:23,873
Do you think there is even
the slightest chance

1261
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:25,083
they won't see it?

1262
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:27,001
But why is the rum gone?

1263
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:29,545
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

1264
01:39:29,588 --> 01:39:31,381
You give it one hour, maybe two,

1265
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:36,386
keep a weather eye open, and you
will see white sails on that horizon.

1266
01:39:41,892 --> 01:39:44,894
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

1267
01:39:44,937 --> 01:39:48,022
"Must've been terrible for you..."
Well, it bloody is now!

1268
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:58,741
There'll be no
living with her after this.

1269
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:00,743
- But we've got to save Will!
- No!

1270
01:40:00,786 --> 01:40:02,245
You're safe now.

1271
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:04,414
We will return to
Port Royal immediately,

1272
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:06,457
not go gallivanting after pirates!

1273
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:08,459
Then we condemn him to death!

1274
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:12,255
The boy's fate is regrettable...

1275
01:40:12,339 --> 01:40:14,924
...but then, so was his decision
to engage in piracy.

1276
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:18,261
To rescue me! To prevent anything
from happening to me!

1277
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:22,181
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion,

1278
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:25,435
the Pearl was listing
near to scuppers after the battle.

1279
01:40:25,477 --> 01:40:28,396
It's very unlikely she'd be able
to make good time.

1280
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:29,772
Think about it.

1281
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:32,066
The Black Pearl.

1282
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:35,653
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

1283
01:40:36,655 --> 01:40:38,614
How can you pass that up?

1284
01:40:40,784 --> 01:40:43,619
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr Sparrow,

1285
01:40:43,662 --> 01:40:46,164
- not only myself.
- Commodore, I beg you!

1286
01:40:46,248 --> 01:40:47,248
Please do this!

1287
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:48,916
For me!

1288
01:40:48,959 --> 01:40:51,127
As a wedding gift.

1289
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:52,378
Elizabeth?

1290
01:40:53,464 --> 01:40:56,007
Are you accepting
the commodore's proposal?

1291
01:40:58,427 --> 01:40:59,469
I am.

1292
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:01,971
A wedding! I love weddings!

1293
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:03,806
Drinks all around!

1294
01:41:06,101 --> 01:41:08,853
I know. "Clap him in irons," right?

1295
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:12,565
Mr Sparrow...

1296
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:16,235
...you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

1297
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,821
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

1298
01:41:18,864 --> 01:41:22,784
You'll then spend the rest of the voyage
contemplating all possible meanings

1299
01:41:22,826 --> 01:41:25,328
of the phrase "silent as the grave."

1300
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:26,954
Do I make myself clear?

1301
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:29,082
Inescapably clear.

1302
01:41:33,879 --> 01:41:35,338
Shiver me timbers!

1303
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:37,757
Cotton says you missed a bit.

1304
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:44,138
You knew William Turner?

1305
01:41:46,016 --> 01:41:48,101
Old Bootstrap Bill.

1306
01:41:48,185 --> 01:41:49,185
We knew him.

1307
01:41:50,187 --> 01:41:54,190
Never sat well with Bootstrap,
what we did to Jack Sparrow,

1308
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:56,317
the mutiny and all.

1309
01:41:56,902 --> 01:41:58,903
He said it wasn't right with the code.

1310
01:41:59,988 --> 01:42:03,157
That's why he sent off a piece of
the treasure to you, as it were.

1311
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:06,828
He said we deserved to be cursed...

1312
01:42:08,413 --> 01:42:10,498
...and remain cursed.

1313
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:11,582
Stupid blighter!

1314
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:13,501
Good man.

1315
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:15,378
But, as you can imagine,

1316
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,798
that didn't sit too well
with the captain.

1317
01:42:18,882 --> 01:42:22,135
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all!

1318
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:25,847
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!

1319
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:32,478
So... what the captain did...

1320
01:42:32,563 --> 01:42:35,148
...he strapped a cannon
to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1321
01:42:35,232 --> 01:42:36,732
Bootstrap's bootstraps!

1322
01:42:36,775 --> 01:42:39,777
Last we saw of ol' Bill Turner...

1323
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:42,321
...he was sinking to
the crushin' black oblivion

1324
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:45,533
of Davy Jones' locker!

1325
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:49,036
'Course it was only after that
we learned we needed his blood

1326
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:50,288
to lift the curse.

1327
01:42:50,372 --> 01:42:53,416
That's what you'd call ironic.

1328
01:42:57,588 --> 01:42:59,213
Bring him!

1329
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:08,431
I don't care for the situation.

1330
01:43:08,974 --> 01:43:12,059
Any attempt to stall in the caves
could turn into an ambush.

1331
01:43:12,102 --> 01:43:15,438
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1332
01:43:15,522 --> 01:43:19,192
I go in and convince Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

1333
01:43:19,276 --> 01:43:22,111
You and your men return to the Dauntless

1334
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:25,406
and blast the bejesus out of them
with your little cannons.

1335
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:26,699
What do you have to lose?

1336
01:43:27,784 --> 01:43:30,286
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1337
01:43:31,955 --> 01:43:33,831
Now, to be quite honest with you,

1338
01:43:33,916 --> 01:43:36,876
there's still a slight risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

1339
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,755
which includes
the future Mrs Commodore.

1340
01:43:40,797 --> 01:43:43,883
- It's for your safety!
- Don't care what the Commodore ordered!

1341
01:43:43,967 --> 01:43:44,967
I have to tell him!

1342
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:48,012
The pirates! They're cursed!
They can't be killed!

1343
01:43:48,096 --> 01:43:50,640
Don't worry, miss.
He's already informed of that.

1344
01:43:50,682 --> 01:43:54,393
A little mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story!

1345
01:43:54,478 --> 01:43:56,562
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

1346
01:44:08,033 --> 01:44:09,492
No reason to fret.

1347
01:44:09,576 --> 01:44:12,161
Just a prick of the finger,
a few drops of blood...

1348
01:44:12,204 --> 01:44:14,205
No mistakes this time.

1349
01:44:14,289 --> 01:44:15,998
He's only half Turner.

1350
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:17,500
We spill it all!

1351
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,754
Guess there is reason to fret.

1352
01:44:35,686 --> 01:44:37,853
Beg your pardon, mate.
Beg your pardon.

1353
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:39,689
- Begun by blood...
- Excuse me.

1354
01:44:39,773 --> 01:44:42,483
By blood un...

1355
01:44:44,861 --> 01:44:45,861
Jack!

1356
01:44:46,905 --> 01:44:47,989
It's not possible!

1357
01:44:48,031 --> 01:44:50,199
Not probable.

1358
01:44:50,242 --> 01:44:52,034
Where's Elizabeth?

1359
01:44:53,412 --> 01:44:55,663
She's safe, just like I promised.

1360
01:44:55,706 --> 01:44:58,666
She's all set to marry Norrington,
just like she promised,

1361
01:44:58,709 --> 01:45:01,085
and you get to die for her,
just like you promised.

1362
01:45:01,169 --> 01:45:03,296
So we're all men of our word, really.

1363
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:06,674
Except for Elizabeth,
who is, in fact, a woman.

1364
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:08,134
Shut up! You're next!

1365
01:45:11,722 --> 01:45:14,557
You don't want to be doing that, mate.

1366
01:45:14,599 --> 01:45:16,559
No, I really think I do.

1367
01:45:18,353 --> 01:45:20,229
Your funeral.

1368
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,401
And why don't I want to be doing it?

1369
01:45:25,444 --> 01:45:27,111
Oh, because...

1370
01:45:28,113 --> 01:45:30,448
Because the HMS Dauntless,

1371
01:45:30,532 --> 01:45:32,950
the pride of the Royal Navy,

1372
01:45:33,035 --> 01:45:36,287
is floating just off shore,

1373
01:45:36,371 --> 01:45:38,080
waiting for you.

1374
01:45:46,256 --> 01:45:47,423
What we doing here?

1375
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:52,762
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1376
01:45:52,804 --> 01:45:54,889
We catch 'em in a crossfire,

1377
01:45:54,931 --> 01:45:57,767
and send 'em down to see Old Hob.

1378
01:45:59,061 --> 01:46:01,437
I know why we're here. I meant...

1379
01:46:01,521 --> 01:46:03,397
...why aren't we doing what it was...

1380
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,274
What Mr Sparrow said we should do?

1381
01:46:05,317 --> 01:46:06,817
With the cannons and all?

1382
01:46:06,902 --> 01:46:09,945
Because it was Mr Sparrow who said it.

1383
01:46:12,574 --> 01:46:15,159
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

1384
01:46:15,243 --> 01:46:17,119
Just hear me out, mate.

1385
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:20,956
You order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best...

1386
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:26,462
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt.
There you are with two ships.

1387
01:46:26,546 --> 01:46:28,964
The makings of your very own fleet.

1388
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:32,635
'Course, you'll take the grandest
as your flagship, and who's to argue?

1389
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:34,136
But what of the Pearl?

1390
01:46:35,764 --> 01:46:37,098
Name me captain.

1391
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:40,601
I'll sail under your colours,
I'll give you ten percent of me plunder,

1392
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:42,853
and you'll get to
introduce yourself as...

1393
01:46:43,438 --> 01:46:46,315
...Commodore Barbossa.

1394
01:46:46,358 --> 01:46:47,441
Savvy?

1395
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:49,693
I suppose, in exchange, you'll be

1396
01:46:49,778 --> 01:46:52,613
- wanting me not to kill the whelp.
- No. Not at all!

1397
01:46:52,656 --> 01:46:54,323
By all means, kill the whelp!

1398
01:46:54,366 --> 01:46:56,784
Just not yet.

1399
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:58,994
Wait to lift the curse

1400
01:46:59,037 --> 01:47:01,705
until the opportune moment.

1401
01:47:05,168 --> 01:47:06,794
For instance...

1402
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:11,924
...after you've killed Norrington's men.

1403
01:47:12,008 --> 01:47:13,592
Every...

1404
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:15,344
...last...

1405
01:47:15,387 --> 01:47:16,846
...one.

1406
01:47:26,481 --> 01:47:28,816
You've been planning this
from the beginning!

1407
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:30,443
Ever since you learned my name!

1408
01:47:31,278 --> 01:47:32,278
Yeah.

1409
01:47:34,614 --> 01:47:36,740
I want 50 percent of your plunder.

1410
01:47:36,825 --> 01:47:37,825
- 15!
- 40!

1411
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:38,868
25!

1412
01:47:40,036 --> 01:47:41,370
And I'll buy you the hat.

1413
01:47:41,413 --> 01:47:43,414
A really big one.

1414
01:47:44,207 --> 01:47:45,374
Commodore.

1415
01:47:48,503 --> 01:47:49,712
We have an accord.

1416
01:47:51,381 --> 01:47:53,674
All hands to the boats!

1417
01:47:54,676 --> 01:47:55,801
Apologies.

1418
01:47:55,886 --> 01:47:57,553
You give the orders.

1419
01:47:58,889 --> 01:47:59,889
Gents...

1420
01:48:00,891 --> 01:48:02,266
...take a walk!

1421
01:48:07,105 --> 01:48:08,439
Not to the boats?

1422
01:49:07,832 --> 01:49:10,751
Hold fire!

1423
01:49:12,796 --> 01:49:15,589
This is just like what
the Greeks done at Troy!

1424
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:18,592
'Cept they was in a horse,

1425
01:49:18,635 --> 01:49:20,094
instead of dresses.

1426
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:22,179
Wooden horse.

1427
01:49:35,151 --> 01:49:36,151
A moment, please.

1428
01:49:40,323 --> 01:49:41,323
Elizabeth?

1429
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:46,370
I just want you to know, I...

1430
01:49:47,497 --> 01:49:49,957
I believe you made a very
good decision today.

1431
01:49:50,792 --> 01:49:52,793
Couldn't be more proud of you!

1432
01:49:53,295 --> 01:49:54,420
But, you know,

1433
01:49:54,504 --> 01:49:57,423
even a good decision,
if made for the wrong reasons,

1434
01:49:57,507 --> 01:49:59,008
can be a wrong decision.

1435
01:50:08,018 --> 01:50:09,018
Lieutenant.

1436
01:50:28,204 --> 01:50:29,371
Elizabeth?

1437
01:50:31,541 --> 01:50:32,791
Are you there?

1438
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:37,671
Elizabeth, are you even listening to me?

1439
01:51:04,783 --> 01:51:06,867
What have you done?

1440
01:51:07,827 --> 01:51:10,496
Stop that!
I already feel like a fool!

1441
01:51:11,539 --> 01:51:12,915
Look nice, though.

1442
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:19,838
Do I look nice now?!

1443
01:51:55,792 --> 01:51:57,042
I must admit, Jack.

1444
01:51:57,127 --> 01:51:59,044
I thought I had you figured.

1445
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:02,297
But it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1446
01:52:02,382 --> 01:52:04,341
Me, I'm dishonest.

1447
01:52:04,426 --> 01:52:07,261
And a dishonest man you can
always trust to be dishonest.

1448
01:52:07,303 --> 01:52:08,554
Honestly...

1449
01:52:08,638 --> 01:52:11,265
...it's the honest ones
you want to watch out for.

1450
01:52:11,307 --> 01:52:13,600
'Cause you can never predict

1451
01:52:13,643 --> 01:52:16,937
when they're going to do
something incredibly...

1452
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:17,980
...stupid.

1453
01:52:51,306 --> 01:52:53,348
You're off the edge of the map, mate.

1454
01:52:53,433 --> 01:52:55,476
Here, there be monsters!

1455
01:53:00,356 --> 01:53:01,690
Right.

1456
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:05,444
What would you pick to eat first?

1457
01:53:05,528 --> 01:53:07,446
I think we should decide now,

1458
01:53:07,530 --> 01:53:09,698
just so we're ready when the time comes!

1459
01:53:34,766 --> 01:53:35,891
What was that?

1460
01:53:58,832 --> 01:53:59,832
It's Elizabeth!

1461
01:54:20,436 --> 01:54:22,104
Make for the ship! Move!

1462
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:17,451
You can't beat me, Jack.

1463
01:55:41,851 --> 01:55:43,268
That's interesting!

1464
01:55:54,155 --> 01:55:56,073
I couldn't resist, mate.

1465
01:57:02,432 --> 01:57:03,640
Sorry!

1466
01:57:12,734 --> 01:57:14,401
So, what now, Jack Sparrow?

1467
01:57:14,444 --> 01:57:17,195
Are we to be two immortals,
locked in an empty battle

1468
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:19,990
until Judgment Day,
when the trumpets sound?

1469
01:57:20,658 --> 01:57:22,075
Or you could surrender.

1470
01:57:49,395 --> 01:57:50,604
All of you with me!

1471
01:57:50,646 --> 01:57:52,731
Will is in that cave,
and we must save him!

1472
01:57:52,815 --> 01:57:55,400
Ready, and... heave!

1473
01:58:01,991 --> 01:58:04,034
Please, I need your help! Come on!

1474
01:58:04,994 --> 01:58:06,828
Any port in a storm.

1475
01:58:06,913 --> 01:58:08,997
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl!

1476
01:58:09,082 --> 01:58:11,333
What about Jack?
Are you just gonna leave him?

1477
01:58:11,417 --> 01:58:13,210
Jack owes us a ship!

1478
01:58:13,294 --> 01:58:14,836
There's the code to consider.

1479
01:58:15,421 --> 01:58:16,546
The code?

1480
01:58:18,299 --> 01:58:20,759
You're pirates!
Hang the code

1481
01:58:20,843 --> 01:58:22,511
and hang the rules!

1482
01:58:22,553 --> 01:58:24,971
They're more like guidelines, anyway.

1483
01:58:28,768 --> 01:58:30,936
Bloody pirates!

1484
01:58:42,365 --> 01:58:44,533
Is it supposed to be doing that?

1485
01:58:44,617 --> 01:58:46,827
They're stealing our ship!

1486
01:58:47,286 --> 01:58:48,954
Bloody pirates!

1487
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,874
Boarders away!

1488
01:59:01,092 --> 01:59:03,093
Come on!

1489
01:59:28,995 --> 01:59:30,328
Me eye!

1490
01:59:50,266 --> 01:59:52,350
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain!

1491
01:59:52,435 --> 01:59:54,019
You like pain?

1492
01:59:55,813 --> 01:59:57,189
Try wearing a corset.

1493
02:00:07,575 --> 02:00:09,201
Whose side is Jack on?

1494
02:00:09,285 --> 02:00:12,329
You mean at the moment?

1495
02:00:47,281 --> 02:00:48,406
No fair!

1496
02:01:12,431 --> 02:01:14,266
Ten years you carry that pistol,

1497
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:16,685
and now you waste your shot!

1498
02:01:17,687 --> 02:01:20,647
He didn't waste it.

1499
02:01:45,298 --> 02:01:46,798
I feel...

1500
02:01:51,387 --> 02:01:52,679
...cold.

1501
02:02:54,950 --> 02:02:57,410
Parley?

1502
02:02:57,453 --> 02:02:59,329
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

1503
02:02:59,413 --> 02:03:01,873
Huzzah! Huzzah!

1504
02:03:10,591 --> 02:03:11,591
Huzzah!

1505
02:03:47,670 --> 02:03:50,004
We should return to the Dauntless.

1506
02:03:52,550 --> 02:03:56,177
Your fiancé will be wanting
to know you're safe.

1507
02:04:05,855 --> 02:04:09,149
If you were waiting for
the opportune moment...

1508
02:04:10,151 --> 02:04:11,484
...that was it.

1509
02:04:12,945 --> 02:04:15,113
Now if you'd be so kind,
I'd be much obliged

1510
02:04:15,197 --> 02:04:18,032
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

1511
02:04:22,621 --> 02:04:24,789
I'm sorry, Jack.

1512
02:04:26,709 --> 02:04:28,918
They done what's right by them.

1513
02:04:29,003 --> 02:04:30,753
Can't expect more than that.

1514
02:04:46,353 --> 02:04:47,687
Jack Sparrow!

1515
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:51,816
- We have learned that you...
- Captain! Captain Jack Sparrow.

1516
02:04:52,526 --> 02:04:55,778
...for your wilful commission
of crimes against the crown.

1517
02:04:55,863 --> 02:04:59,574
Said crimes being numerous in quantity,

1518
02:04:59,658 --> 02:05:01,201
and sinister in nature.

1519
02:05:01,869 --> 02:05:03,369
The most egregious of these

1520
02:05:03,412 --> 02:05:05,622
to be cited herewith:

1521
02:05:05,706 --> 02:05:09,459
- Piracy, smuggling...
- This is wrong.

1522
02:05:10,461 --> 02:05:13,463
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law,

1523
02:05:13,547 --> 02:05:16,090
as are we all.

1524
02:05:16,133 --> 02:05:18,843
...impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

1525
02:05:18,928 --> 02:05:22,013
impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England...

1526
02:05:22,097 --> 02:05:23,223
Oh, yes!

1527
02:05:23,265 --> 02:05:25,266
Sailing under false colours,

1528
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:29,562
arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching,

1529
02:05:29,605 --> 02:05:35,568
brigandage, pilfering,
depravity, depredation,

1530
02:05:35,611 --> 02:05:37,445
and general lawlessness.

1531
02:05:38,822 --> 02:05:40,490
And for these crimes,

1532
02:05:40,574 --> 02:05:43,117
you have been sentenced to be,
on this day,

1533
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:46,913
hung by the neck, until dead.

1534
02:05:46,956 --> 02:05:49,249
May God have mercy on your soul.

1535
02:05:49,291 --> 02:05:50,833
Governor Swann.

1536
02:05:50,918 --> 02:05:52,835
Commodore.

1537
02:05:54,338 --> 02:05:55,338
Elizabeth.

1538
02:05:56,799 --> 02:05:59,634
I should've told you every day,
from the moment I met you.

1539
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:03,972
I love you.

1540
02:06:18,529 --> 02:06:20,280
Boy, watch yourself!

1541
02:06:20,322 --> 02:06:21,447
Marines!

1542
02:06:21,490 --> 02:06:23,032
I can't breathe!

1543
02:06:24,952 --> 02:06:25,952
Elizabeth!

1544
02:06:28,956 --> 02:06:29,998
Move!

1545
02:06:40,884 --> 02:06:43,094
You men! With me!

1546
02:07:17,087 --> 02:07:18,087
Come on, men!

1547
02:07:43,697 --> 02:07:47,700
I thought we might have to endure some
manner of ill-conceived escape attempt.

1548
02:07:48,535 --> 02:07:50,119
But not from you.

1549
02:07:50,204 --> 02:07:51,579
On our return to Port Royal,

1550
02:07:51,664 --> 02:07:54,040
I granted you clemency.

1551
02:07:54,083 --> 02:07:55,750
And this is how you thank me?

1552
02:07:55,793 --> 02:07:57,877
By throwing in your lot with him?

1553
02:07:57,920 --> 02:07:59,504
He's a pirate!

1554
02:07:59,588 --> 02:08:01,547
And a good man.

1555
02:08:02,341 --> 02:08:04,592
If all I've achieved here
is that the hangman

1556
02:08:04,635 --> 02:08:06,761
will own two pairs
of boots instead of one,

1557
02:08:06,845 --> 02:08:08,471
so be it.

1558
02:08:08,555 --> 02:08:10,431
At least my conscience will be clear.

1559
02:08:10,474 --> 02:08:13,434
You forget your place, Turner.

1560
02:08:14,978 --> 02:08:16,604
It's right here,

1561
02:08:16,647 --> 02:08:18,106
between you and Jack.

1562
02:08:22,111 --> 02:08:23,778
As is mine.

1563
02:08:23,862 --> 02:08:25,238
Elizabeth!

1564
02:08:26,699 --> 02:08:27,865
Lower your weapons.

1565
02:08:28,659 --> 02:08:30,660
For goodness sake, put them down!

1566
02:08:35,749 --> 02:08:38,668
So this is where
your heart truly lies, then.

1567
02:08:40,295 --> 02:08:41,796
It is.

1568
02:08:50,305 --> 02:08:54,183
Well! I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

1569
02:08:54,268 --> 02:08:56,769
I think we've all arrived
at a very special place.

1570
02:08:56,812 --> 02:08:57,895
Spiritually.

1571
02:08:57,980 --> 02:08:59,981
Ecumenically.

1572
02:09:00,065 --> 02:09:01,274
Grammatically.

1573
02:09:02,735 --> 02:09:05,319
I want you to know that
I was rooting for you, mate.

1574
02:09:06,613 --> 02:09:07,613
Know that.

1575
02:09:11,618 --> 02:09:13,119
Elizabeth.

1576
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:17,665
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1577
02:09:19,126 --> 02:09:21,002
I'm sorry.

1578
02:09:23,130 --> 02:09:24,130
Will!

1579
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:28,092
Nice hat.

1580
02:09:30,053 --> 02:09:31,637
Friends!

1581
02:09:33,557 --> 02:09:36,350
This the day that you will always

1582
02:09:36,393 --> 02:09:39,020
remember as the day that...

1583
02:09:43,984 --> 02:09:46,652
Idiot! He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose!

1584
02:09:49,072 --> 02:09:50,907
Sail ho!

1585
02:09:58,457 --> 02:10:01,083
What's your plan of action?

1586
02:10:01,835 --> 02:10:02,835
Sir?

1587
02:10:07,216 --> 02:10:09,675
Perhaps on the rare occasion

1588
02:10:09,718 --> 02:10:13,596
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

1589
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:17,475
piracy itself can be the right course?

1590
02:10:21,730 --> 02:10:23,022
Mr Turner!

1591
02:10:29,112 --> 02:10:31,948
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1592
02:10:37,913 --> 02:10:39,539
This is a beautiful sword.

1593
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,751
I would expect the man who made it

1594
02:10:43,794 --> 02:10:48,589
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

1595
02:10:50,634 --> 02:10:52,385
Thank you.

1596
02:10:55,264 --> 02:10:56,305
Commodore!

1597
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:58,099
What about Sparrow?

1598
02:11:00,018 --> 02:11:02,937
Oh, I think we can afford
to give him one day's head start.

1599
02:11:12,197 --> 02:11:15,283
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

1600
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:18,953
After all...

1601
02:11:18,996 --> 02:11:20,538
...he is a blacksmith.

1602
02:11:21,540 --> 02:11:22,790
No.

1603
02:11:27,504 --> 02:11:29,797
He's a pirate.

1604
02:11:53,989 --> 02:11:55,656
Bring him in!

1605
02:12:06,043 --> 02:12:08,628
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the code.

1606
02:12:08,670 --> 02:12:11,339
We figured they were more actual...

1607
02:12:11,423 --> 02:12:13,382
...guidelines.

1608
02:12:17,512 --> 02:12:19,221
Thank you.

1609
02:12:20,349 --> 02:12:21,724
Captain Sparrow.

1610
02:12:26,021 --> 02:12:27,605
The Black Pearl is yours!

1611
02:12:43,413 --> 02:12:45,081
On deck, you scabrous dogs!

1612
02:12:45,165 --> 02:12:46,624
Hands to braces!

1613
02:12:46,708 --> 02:12:48,960
Let go and haul to run free.

1614
02:12:50,629 --> 02:12:52,421
Now...

1615
02:12:52,506 --> 02:12:54,340
Bring me that horizon.

1616
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:03,724

1617
02:13:07,062 --> 02:13:09,563
Drink up, me hearties
